    	<h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
    	<p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) refers to the broader class of distributed ledgers that include blockchain and directed acyclic graphs. Blockchain, the most familiar form of DLT, has transitioned from cryptocurrencies to Smart Contracts and current further development resolving deficiencies in scalability, interoperability, sustainability, privacy, and governance.</p>
        <p>The Distributed Identity Foundation, with members including Microsoft and IBM, is working with the W3C and the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project to develop a unified, interoperable ecosystem allowing users to control and store identity information by creating a decentralized digital identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).</p>
        <p>Using DLT, a much-needed evolution of the internet will create a common identity layer allowing people, organizations, and things to have their own discrete SSI. This will alter the future of big data, giving control of identity back to the owners, allowing full regulation of who can use their data and how it can be used.</p>
        <p>The aim is to create a new system of applications and products that enable developers and businesses to offer solely client-side services—giving every person their own portable digital identity securely stored to preserve privacy.</p>
        <p>This research contributes a Comprehensive analysis of Distributed Ledger Technology, specifically the generations of blockchain and limitations that are being resolved. The analysis then covers the parts of an SSI: Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, and Identity Agents, and documents current development by Hyperledger Identity Stack, Atala Prism, and the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p>

    	<h2>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h2>
        <p>We live at a time where the world is driven by big data, transforming systems across society, including traffic, health, government, logistics, and national defense. This data is currently concentrated in "islands" by governments, internet giants, and communications institutes. However, these islands lack data credibility as there is no quality verification, and as such, they are not conducive to scientific research <a id="link_Li_2017" href="#Li_2017">[Li_2017]</a>.</p>
        <p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) drew attention more recently, providing tamper-proof distributed ledgers verified by a trustless consensus of the system's participants. DLT technology is a global foundation for building cryptographic digital trust between companies, individuals, and machines - Trust over IP <a id="link_ToIP_2020" href="#ToIP_2020">[ToIP_2020]</a>, removing the necessity for trusted third-party intermediaries.</p>
        <p>Blockchain (BC), the most familiar form of DLT, takes its place as the fifth disruptive computing paradigm following mainframes, PCs, the Internet, and mobile/social networking <a id="link_Swan_2015" href="#Swan_2015">[Swan_2015]</a>. BC's generations started with Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency enabling transactions between two parties without a trusted third party: Blockchain 1.0. Adding Turing complete terms and conditions to cryptocurrency transactions by embedding a programming language, Ethereum took its place issuing in Blockchain 2.0. Blockchain 3.0 is a catchall term relating to work in progress to ensure sufficient infrastructure for mainstream use of BC, solving scalability, interoperability, sustainability, privacy, and governability. One major change that Blockchain 3.0 aims to bring will alter the future of big data, giving control of identity back to the data-owners, allowing their full regulation of who can use their data and how that data can be used. This will require a change or replacement of existing big-data systems <a id="link_Karafiloski_2017" href="#Karafiloski_2017">[Karafiloski_2017]</a>.</p>
        <p>The Distributed Identity Foundation, with members including Microsoft and IBM, is working with the W3C and the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project to develop a unified, interoperable ecosystem allowing users to control and store identity information by creating a decentralized digital identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The aim is to create a new system of applications and products that enable developers and businesses to offer solely client-side services. "Every person has a right to an identity that they own and control, one that securely stores elements of their digital identity and preserves privacy <a id="link_Microsoft_2019" href="#Microsoft_2019">[Microsoft_2019]</a>."</p>
        <p class="talj">The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1.1 covers the motivation of SSI. Chapter 2 expands the principles underneath SSI in Section 2.1: Distributed Ledger</p>

        <p class="ti0">Technology and its subsets Blockchain, and its 1.0 and 2.0 varieties, and Directed Acyclic Graph. Section 2.2 explores the state-of-the-art work in Blockchain 3.0 and a brief forecast of SSI work in progress. Section 2.3 describes the components of SSIs: Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, and Identity Agents. Chapter 3 investigates software design and development in the SSI ecosystem. Chapter 4 discusses further uses of SSI and my untested original plan, followed by the conclusions and future remarks.</p>
	
        <h4 id="Motivation">1.1 - Motivation</h4>
        <p>A much-needed evolution of the Internet is creating a common identity layer allowing people, organizations, and things to have their own discrete SSI. This SSI ecosystem can now be built on top of DLT.
In the connected world of the Internet, digital identity has progressed from a centralized authority (e.g., IANA, ICANN) to administrative control by multiple federated authorities (e.g., Microsoft Passport, Liberty Alliance, Facebook Login, Google Login), and on to user-centric individual control (e.g., OpenID, OAuth, FIDO). The concept of a self-sovereign identity is now coming into attention, requiring that users be the ruler of their own identity <a id="link_Allen_2016" href="#Allen_2016">[Allen_2016]</a>.</p>
        <p>The current system of siloed identities and passwords has existed since the Internet was first built as “the Internet was created without an identity layer <a id="link_Cameron_2005" href="#Cameron_2005">[Cameron_2005]</a>.” Meaning that the Internet’s addressing system is based on identifying physical endpoints, or machines, not the people who use those machines. As such, the Internet has no way to identify people uniquely.</p>
        <p class="talj">Usernames and passwords are deeply embedded in the fabric of the Web, even though they are widely acknowledged to be bad user experience and provoke use in an unsafe manner (i.e., reuse same username and password across multiple/all sites). All the user sees is another siloed website or app that demands the same details that they have given to the last X number of services that they want to use, asking yet again for another username and password. The user is left with tens or hundreds of fragments of themselves disseminated across distributed organizations with no control over the data’s security, rather than a consolidated digital identity. Another undesirable repercussion in the system of multiple isolated accounts is that the person’s identity and personal data exist solely in the context of each individual website or app. Should they choose to leave that app, all that digital existence becomes valueless to their ongoing use of other apps and websites. However, leaving the website or app (that has internet access) does not mean that all identity information was removed. Unless specifically requested by the user, all personal data the user has given the account will likely remain and be a risk to the company and</p>

        <p class="ti0">individual in the case of a hack. As a silo’s stash of data grows, so too does the opportunity for a fraudster or hacker.</p>
        <p>Despite over 25 years of advances in internet technology, assertions about an identity owner (i.e., claims) are impossible to verify, and as such, are hard to trust. In the physical world, credentials are carried in wallets, allowing one to prove claims by showing credentials issued by a trusted authority.  Although a physical credential is relatively easy to verify, to some degree, by human judgment, a digital image of that credential is usually unverifiable, as it could be a copy used by someone other than the actual credential owner.</p>
        <p>The Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) has been working for eleven years with twenty-three workshops looking for better internet identity solutions. The ideal internet identity system would allow an entity (i.e., person, organization, for thing) to have an identity relationship, or claim, with any other without requiring authorization from any outside entity - one that is self-sovereign (i.e., entirely self-owned and controlled). SSI is the natural evolution of the internet ecosystem that is advancing at a more rapid pace than which its supporting capabilities can keep up.</p>
        <p>A standardized, machine-readable format must be defined to permit verification of the source and integrity of the digital credential. A commonly accepted digital signature, in the form of two keys – private key for signing and public key for verifying that the signature and signed digital document had not been tampered with. To verify a signature, one must have access to the public key and verify that the public key obtained is correct. These public keys are currently stored on a couple hundred certificate authorities (CA). This small source enables browsers to get the website’s public key to enable an encrypted HTTPS connection. However, the public-key infrastructure (PKI) supplied by CA are cumbersome, costly, and centralized – so companies, not individuals, are the purchasers of digital certificates.</p>
        <p>DLT, specifically a public BC, offers a decentralized PKI (DPKI) that nobody owns and everyone can use. This can replace trust in humans to verify identification claims, to one where cryptography, in a machine-readable way, is stored immutably. </p>
        <p>Through DLT, the same process can be used to verify identity online that has been used offline for centuries. Every decentralized identifier (DID) has an associated public-private key pair. As long as the verifier can access the DID of the issuer (recorded publicly on a BC) shown on the digital credential, it is quick and easy to look up the issuer and verify the signature on the claims. Following this process, there is no need for identity federations or islands of identity for PKI  <a id="link_Sovrin_2019" href="#Sovrin_2019">[Sovrin_2019,</a> <a id="link_Tobin_2016" href="#Tobin_2016">Tobin_2016]</a>.</p>

        <p class="ti0">All blockchains follow the following procedure:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The originator digitally signs each transaction in the BC.</li>
            <li>Each transaction is stored in blocks that are chained to the previous block via a digital hash.</li>
            <li>Validated via a consensus algorithm (see <a href="#MoC">section 2.1.1.1</a>), transactions are replicated across all nodes (machines) that store the BC (i.e., all PC-based wallets).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>DLT and BC are explained in greater depth in <a href="#DLT">section 2.1</a>. Stated simply, they allow the foundation on which SSI can be built. An SSI is divided into the following components: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Identity – explored in <a href="#SSI_components">section 2.3</a>.</p>
        <p>Identity is an inherent human condition; it is not conditional on outside administration. However, granting control of digital identities to centralized authorities leaves users locked to a single authority that can deny their identity or confirm a false identity. Centralization gives power to the centralized authorities, not the users. In the creation of an SSI, the individual must be carefully protected. The goal of digital identity is to make identity information widely available, crossing international boundaries, without losing user control, redefining modern concepts of identity. An SSI must be transportable, not locked down to one site or locale <a href="#Allen_2016">[Allen_2016]</a>.</p>
        <p>Identity also needs to be widely available for everyone, no matter their location or situation. According to the World Bank, almost 15% of the world’s population was without ID <a id="link_Desai_2017" href="#Desai_2017">[Desai_2017]</a>. In addition, more than half of the world is currently offline. Banking the</p>
        <p>unbanked, as Cardano is attempting to do through their Atala Prism (see Section 3.2), is partly done through giving people without ID an SSI. Many of those without ID live in remote areas with little access to electricity, mobile service, or even wired telephone service. This makes inclusion for all people difficult. Cardano is making strides in that direction in Africa, partnering with World Mobile, which aims to connect the unconnected by providing decentralized low-cost, sustainable, and profitable internet to remote villages across Tanzania and eventually other areas. Cardano then provides them with an SSI through Atala Prism, giving them further financial opportunities <a id="link_Desai_2017" href="#Desai_2017">[Cardano_2021]</a>.</p>

        <p>With the recent refugee crisis, resulting in multiple people without a recognized identity, and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation’s (GDPR) attempt to regulate customer data and privacy abuses, the need for a digital Self-Sovereign Identifier (SSI) is emphasized.</p>
        <p>One main issue that the GDPR demands is the “right to erasure” or “right to be forgotten,” allowing users to request the company “forgets” them, removing every instance of their data from the company’s system. This presents several challenges for data collectors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Checking to confirm the is a request from the actual user.</li>
            <li>Deciding, with legal help and expense, what data should be removed.</li>
            <li>Finding all iterations of that data across their servers in different locations and successfully deleting it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more regarding GDPR and its applicability regarding BC, see <a href="#GDPR">Appendix B</a>.</p>
        <p>The premise of SSI is that it is an identity wholly owned by the controller without authorization or management by a central entity. An SSI controller could be an individual controlling their personal data, the owner of the IoT device keeping its data guarded against outside access, or an employee/manager of an entity (e.g., government department, licensing department, corporation, business, etc.). To use an SSI, the controller/holder presents claims about their identity that can be cryptographically verified by the verifier that desires to check them <a id="link_Govind_2020" href="#Govind_2020">[Govind_2020]</a>.</p>

        <p>With an identity that people and organizations can bring, quickly and securely verifiable by a verifying party, the online economy can move towards a just-in-time identity. Eliminating the necessity by organizations to store large quantities of personal data just in case it is needed. Instead, an organization could simply store the bare minimum required to re-identify the user on their return visit, request and process any necessary data during that visit, and then dispose of any data that is not obligatory after the user leaves. With the knowledge that the organization can always request that data when/if the user returns. The aforementioned bare minimum that the organization would need to retain would be the DID of its customers. After a returning customer presents their DID, the organization could request proof of a claim that the organization initially provided the customer. On receiving proof of the claim, the organization could prove that it was issued by them and not revoked or altered.</p>
        <p>Use of this just-in-time identity would be of mutual benefit to the user and organizations. To the user, by not having to remember multiple usernames and passwords and have a consistent accumulation of all data from all sites. To the organization(s) from spending excess money accumulating personal data from multiple silos, financing the protection of that data, or purchasing extensive digital storage space.</p>
        <p>If the SSI ecosystem is the next natural step in the evolution of the internet identity, providing trust, portability, security, and removal of a single point of failure, then cryptographically secure DLT is the necessary foundational step on which it can be grounded.</p>
        <p>The future of an active SSI ecosystem will include changes across the Internet. Most notably, there will be changes in how Big Data is collected and whether it will retain its ability to be collected legally or otherwise – e.g., through privacy-preserving zero-knowledge-proofs (ZKP). Investigation and documentation of changes and potential workarounds for big-data collection are needed to anticipate when SSI use becomes standard across the web.</p>
        <p class="ti0">SSI targets include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving digital identity to where it exceeds that of paper identification. Exceeding paper identification by providing cryptographic verification that:</li>

            <li>Giving ownership of digital data back to the individual stored on their device(s) (e.g., phone) instead of that data being maintained and owned by a third-party service provider offering the individual a “free service.”</li>
            <li>Maintaining a data minimization policy to avoid the current situation of third-party ‘honeypots’ that are targets of hackers.</li>
            <li>Allowing identity data, in the hands of the individual, to be a portable, acceptable proof of identity between businesses, cities, and even countries (e.g., refugees).</li>
            <li>Avoiding centralization of identity data through the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the targets mentioned above, globally verifiable unique identities using DLT allow for transparent, open-source data collection leaving data sources un-targetable. This could be beneficial for numerous academic studies, such as anthropological studies, and for individuals seeking to expand their horizons or seek fellow-minded others.</p>
        <p>This SSI ecosystem is still under development and should be available for everyday use in the next 5-15 years, depending on where in the world one is, marking a future as full of potential as the beginnings of the world wide web.</p>

        <h4 id="DLT">2.1 - Distributed Ledger Technology</h4>
        <p>DLT has come to describe a broader class of technology that includes BC and directed acyclic graph (DAG). The most popular definition of a BC is “a distributed or decentralized ledger” <a id="link_Frizzo-Barker_2019" href="#Frizzo-Barker_2019">[Frizzo-Barker_2019]</a>. However, BC is a subset of distributed ledgers.</p>
        <p>Distributed ledgers offer a decentralized infrastructure realizing ‘a single version of truth’ in a linked record from the chain’s origin - referred to as the genesis block. This is done without the need for a central authority as all nodes in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network share the same full copy of the database (ledger), thereby avoiding a single point of failure (SPF) <a id="link_Zachariadis_2019" href="#Zachariadis_2019">[Zachariadis_2019]</a>.</p>
        <p>Distributed ledgers come with permissionless and permissioned transaction validation (permission to write) and public and private access (permission to read), as seen in Table 1. A company internally may choose to use a permissioned ledger with either public or private visibility, while most cryptocurrencies operate as public permissionless ledgers. Consortium ledgers are another type of permissioned ledger with equally qualified nodes often held by different entities (i.e., corporations).</p>

        <h4 id="BC">2.1.1 - Blockchain</h4>
        <p>BC is the most well-known form of DLT. Fundamentally, a BC offers a peer-to-peer continually growing tamper-proof distributed ledger or database of records linked through cryptography. Each transaction stored is verified by consensus of the nodes (participants in the system).  Transaction data is intended to be immutable once added to the chain. One party to a transaction initiates a process by requesting validating nodes to include that transaction in a block and broadcasting the block to the network. Once a block is verified through consensus of the nodes, it is added to the chain and stored across the web, resulting in a unique timestamped record with a unique history.</p>
		<p>On a BC, a data block is divided into two parts: header and body. The body’s transactions are each hashed, and the Merkle Root <a id="link_Merkle_1990" href="#Merkle_1990">[Merkle_1990]</a> is the combination of all sub hashes. The header contains the hash of the previous block as well as the Merkle root of the body. This allows for the chaining of blocks and confirmation that all sub-data is verifiably unchanged, see Figure 1.</p>
        <div class="image">
        	<img src="imgs/Figure_01.png" alt="Figure 1: Simplified blockchain structure showing Merkle root hash structure."/>
            <p><b>Figure 1:</b> Simplified blockchain block structure <a id="link_Frauenthaler_2019" href="#Frauenthaler_2019">[Frauenthaler_2019]</a></p> 
        </div>
        <p>With reliability, transparency, traceability, and immutability, BCs enable collaboration that does not rely on the legal system to enforce agreements.</p>
        <p>Although records are meant to be immutable, there is the possibility of forks, such as with the DAO hack that resulted in the splitting of the Ethereum BC.  Two separate chains were the result: Ethereum (rolled back to a point before the DAO attack) and Ethereum Classic (that said code is law, the vulnerabilities in the code made it possible). Hard-forks that erase records are rare, as they require agreement by a majority of nodes.</p>

        <h4 id="MoC">2.1.1.1 - Means of consensus</h4>
        <p>Public BCs are distributed and not controlled by any single party. Ways to ensure that nodes are not malicious, contain accurate information, and contain a single accepted history attempt to resolve the Byzantine Generals Problem <a id="link_Lamport_2019" href="#Lamport_2019">[Lamport_2019]</a>. Bitcoin’s innovative attempt offered a means of consensus (MoC) called Proof of Work (PoW). While PoW is useful when a BC has a limited network, and many cryptocurrencies have used PoW in their nascent stage (e.g., Ethereum), other attempts to resolve drawbacks of PoW are being tested by other BCs <a id="link_Lee_2019" href="#Lee_2019">[Lee_2019]</a>. These include Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Delayed PoW (DPoW), Proof of Burn (PoB), Proof of Capacity (PoC), Proof of Communication (PoC) <a id="link_Chen_2019" href="#Chen_2019">[Chen_2019]</a>, and Proof of Activity (PoA) <a id="link_Liu_2019" href="#Liu_2019">[Liu_2019]</a>. Varieties specific to permissioned chains: Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), Tendermint, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) <a id="link_Viriyasitavat_2019" href="#Viriyasitavat_2019">[Viriyasitavat_2019]</a>, and others <a id="link_Zheng_2017" href="#Zheng_2017">[Zheng_2017]</a>.</p>
        
        <h5>Proof of Work</h5>
        <p>PoW requires miners to attempt guessing a nonce (value) that, when combined with the SHA-256 hash of the proposed block, results in a leading number of zeros. The first miner to correctly compute the nonce is given a predetermined prize of coins. The number of zeros required is updated according to the miners’ (nodes’) average computing power, allowing the approximate creation of one new block every 10 minutes. Due to the previous block’s hash value being included in each new block’s header, the new nonce values for any change would have to be updated in the entire chain onward from the altered block. The computing power required for this is realistically unfeasible unless more than 50% of nodes collaborate maliciously.</p> 
        <p>However, Bitcoin currently allows application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to be used in mining. This enables mining pools to work collaboratively and thus gain a large majority of hashing power, potentially altering the chain in their favor. China hosts the largest Bitcoin mining pools, over 79% total hash power, yet no individual pool is over 25%.</p>
        <p>Since PoW resembles a lottery for the winning miner if more than one miner guesses the correct nonce a fork could be created. Bitcoin deals with this issue by having honest miners choose to append new blocks and validate the longest chain. Alternate correct guesses that have a shorter chain, and are unused, are called uncles.</p>
	</section>
    <footer>?</footer>
</section><!-- END #MoC.page.hf -->
<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <p class="title">PoW has the current drawbacks:</p>
        <ul>
			<li>Waste of electricity, as miners spend large amounts of computing power for essentially a lottery ticket <a id="link_Stoll_2019" href="#Stoll_2019">[Stoll_2019,</a> <a id="link_Sutherland_2019" href="#Sutherland_2019">Sutherland_2019]</a>. However, as pointed out in <a href="#Frizzo-Barker_2019">[Frizzo-Barker_2019</a>], creating fiat currency also uses significant power.</li>
        	<li>Slower throughput. Bitcoin has the difficulty set to one block every 10 minutes corresponding with current computing power.</li>
		</ul>
        
        <h5>Proof of Stake</h5>
        <p>PoS is the next best-known and used MoC. In PoS, the amount of stake (coins) that a stakeholder has is used with a randomized process to elect which stakeholder produces a block. The more stake an individual has, the more likely they will be picked. Successful block creation allows the block producer to gain interest on the amount staked. More public BCs are moving toward PoS as it wastes less electricity than PoW. PoS is being integrated into Ethereum 2.0 in Serenity, its first stage also known as “beacon chain.” However, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the virtual machine running smart contracts,  still operates on Ethereum 1.0, which uses PoW.</p>
       <p> Some PoS systems solve honest behavior by locking the stake, requiring stakeholder honesty in block creation, or their stake will be destroyed/slashed (Ethereum 2.0). In the case of stake locking, some chains require a specific term of time that the coins are frozen, decreasing the cryptocurrency’s liquidity. Other chains require a specific quantity of coins to participate in staking (e.g., Ethereum 2.0 requires 32 ETH to participate in staking), thus excluding those with a small amount of coins.</p> 
        <p>The Cardano BC uses Ouroboros, a version of PoS for consensus <a id="link_Kiayias_2016" href="#Kiayias_2016">[Kiayias_2016]</a>. In Ouroboros, a randomized process is used to elect a stakeholder to produce a block based on the stake’s weight. Since individuals typically do not have a significant enough stake to be elected, they can delegate their stake to a stake pool, thereby collectively participating in a large enough stake for the stake pool to be elected. There is no minimum stake through this system, no locking of coins, and no slashing required. ADA, the name for coins on the Cardano BC, is freely fungible (i.e., liquid) at any time and can be redelegated from the end of the current epoch plus one epoch (~6-10 days).</p>
        
		<h5>Delegated Proof of Stake</h5>
		<p>DPoS is similar to PoS. With ‘delegated’ meaning that holders’ stake is used to elect a fixed, limited number of delegates who are chosen based on reputation. In the election, the voting power favors those with a larger amount of cryptocurrency staked.</p>
        </ul>
	</section>
    <footer>?</footer>
</section><!-- END #.page.hf -->
<section class="page hf">
	<section>
        <p>The delegates must maintain the smooth running of their node to validate transactions and act in the network’s best interest or be voted out. The block producers alone receive rewards for their work to maintain the network.</p>
        <p>The advantages of having a smaller number to process transactions are the increase in speed and more energy efficiency than PoW and PoS. A disadvantage is the requirement of active participation by coin holders in voting. Another is the potential centralization as a smaller number of delegates can more easily collaborate maliciously.</p>
        
        <h5>Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h5>
        <p>The PBFT model provides a means to tolerate some Byzantine faults (malicious nodes) by assuming that there are independent node failures propagated by specific independent nodes. PBFT is unique in that only one network member becomes the primary participant who communicates with all other participants to validate a specific block, removing the chance of a fork. PBFT and its variants are widely used in consortium (private) chains with foreknowledge of a fixed (smaller) number of known participants. They can tolerate up to a third of participants having any form of Byzantine fault <a id="link_Castro_1999" href="#Castro_1999">[Castro_1999]</a>.</p>
        <h4 id="BC1.0">3.1 - Blockchain 1.0: Cryptocurrency</h4>
        <p>Bitcoin, the seminal BC, was designed to be a decentralized P2P electronic cash system, enabling pseudonymous transactions through advanced cryptography without requiring third-party authorization <a id="link_Nakamoto_2008" href="#Nakamoto_2008">[Nakamoto_2008]</a>. This type of decentralized electronic cash system is termed a cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p>A BC network relies on asymmetric encryption - generating two ciphers, or key pair: public key to encrypt and private key to decrypt. Information encrypted with the public key, which can be shared with others, can only be unlocked with the private key, which should be kept private. The private key cannot be calculated via the public key; hence it is safe to release the public key to the public <a id="link_Guo_2019" href="#Guo_2019">[Guo_2019]</a>. The pseudonymity of transactions occurs as transactions are listed as between the sender and receiver’s public keys.</p>
        <p class="talj">While Bitcoin offers pseudonymity, users are not entirely anonymous. If a user posts their public address (key) on social media, their transactions can be monitored even with the use of Coinjoin or another mixer. If a user desires to use cryptocurrency for the sake of anonymity, such as through utilizing Tor, Bitcoin should be used with caution.</p>

        <p class="ti0">Suppose a user chooses to use Bitcoin for the sake of anonymity. In that case, they should not post any knowledge of their account on any social media as it can be traced in logs that are publicly accessible. Transactions on BCs (www.blockchain.com/api) include both the timestamp of the transaction as well as the relay IP address. <a id="link_Cui_2019" href="#Cui_2019">[Cui_2019,</a> <a id="link_Jawaheri_2020" href="#Jawaheri_2020">Jawaheri_2020]</a>.</p>
        
        <h4 id="BC2.0">3.2 - Blockchain 2.0: Smart Contracts</h4>
        <p>SCs were introduced by Nick Szabo in 1996 <a id="link_Szabo_1996" href="#Szabo_1996">[Szabo_1996]</a> as a means to facilitate, verify, or enforce the terms of an agreement without the need of a third party, giving an example of a vending machine <a id="link_Szabo_1997" href="#Szabo_1997">[Szabo_1997]</a>. Being the forerunner of BC, Bitcoin implemented simple SCs on a stack-based design.  However, Blockchain 2.0 typically refers to Ethereum and the innovation of Turing-complete SCs on the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) <a id="link_Wood_2014" href="#Wood_2014">[Wood_2014]</a>. EVM set the stage with smart contracts growing more complex and intricate. Dapps, DAOs, DACs, and DASs are some examples, with BC transactions no longer restricted to payments and currency transfers <a href="#Swan_2015">[Swan_2015]</a>.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Decentralized application (Dapp): A Dapp is an application that runs on a network in a distributed fashion with participant’s information securely protected. Operation execution happens automatically at the fulfillment of preset conditions.</li>
        	<li>Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC): DAOs and DACs are more complex forms of decentralized apps. To become an organization or corporation, a Dapp might adopt a constitution that would outline its governance publicly on the BC, defining a means to finance its operations.</li>
        	<li>Decentralized autonomous societies (DAS): DAS refers to the idea of self-bootstrapping software to crowdfund itself based on a mission statement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="title">Ethereum is the most well-known BC that works with SCs, and it is currently #2 in market capitalization. However, it has some security bugs:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Time Order Dependent (TOD) contracts:</b> If two submissions to the same contract are order dependent but come at a similar time, they may be included by the miners in a different order, such affecting the resulting payments. (e.g., X is a computation by a  user for a prelisted prize, and Y is an update by the designer of the contract for the resulting prize. If both X and Y are submitted around the same time, and say Y is updating the prize to zero, if they are submitted in reverse order, the user who submitted X would lose their prize.)</li>
        	<li><b>Timestamp dependent:</b> Contracts may use the timestamp as a trigger condition to</li>

        <ul>
            <li class="lstn">execute some critical operations. However, the miner sets the timestamp for the block, ordinarily using the miner’s system’s current time. The miner is permitted to vary this value by roughly 900 seconds, allowing, in an example of a jackpot contract, the miner to bias the results in their favor.</li>
        	<li><b>Mishandled exceptions:</b> In Ethereum, contracts are permitted to call other contracts. If there were an exception (e.g., not enough gas or exceeding call stack limit) in the called contract, it would terminate and return false. The calling contract may not receive the propagated exception depending on whether the caller explicitly checks. This inconsistency can lead to incorrectly handled exceptions.</li>
        	<li><b>Reentrancy vulnerability:</b> In Ethereum, when a contract calls another, the calling contract waits for the call to finish. This can lead to an exploit when the caller makes use of the intermediate state.</li>

        <p class="talj">SCs in Ethereum are built using a custom Javascript-like object-oriented, state-based programming language, Solidity. There is current work on Vyper, a non-Turing-complete Python-like deterministic language that will come into play in Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum 1.0 uses PoW, but it is transitioning to PoS in its 2.0 version. Ethereum 2.0 will come in three stages, Phase 0, 1, and 2. Phase 0, the Beacon Chain, storing and managing the registry of validators and deploying the PoS consensus mechanism, went live in</p>
        <p class="ti0">December 2020. However, SCs are still run on the main chain (the original PoW chain) till Phase 1, due in 2021, comes out.</p>
        <p>Cardano SCs are scheduled to go mainnet and be available at the end of July 2021, following the testnet release and active development at the end of April to early May 2021. The SC programming platform for Cardano is called Plutus <a id="link_Input-Output-HK" href="#Input-Output-HK">[Input-Output-HK]</a>, based on Lambda Calculus and Haskell. Haskell is a purely functional programming language, offering deterministic stateless functions typically with no side effects. All code is written in Haskell, with off-chain code compiled by Haskell’s GHC compiler and on-chain code with the Plutus compiler.  In addition to the Plutus platform, Cardano offers Marlowe, a special-purpose programming language for financial contracts. The Marlowe playground is available for writing Marlowe contracts in several ways, allowing the analysis of smart contract behavior by simulating participants’ activity. Marlowe contracts can be written directly as Marlowe text or with Blockly, a visual drag and drop programming tool for non-developers. Alternatively, as Marlowe is embedded in Haskell and JavaScript, those programming languages can be used initially and converted to Marlowe and Blockly through the Marlowe playground <a id="link_iohkdev.io" href="#iohkdev.io">[iohkdev.io]</a>.</p>

                <p>In mathematics, specifically graph theory, and computer science, a DAG is a form of directed graph without closed cycles. Topological ordering requires that all edges start from a vertex temporally previous to the end vertex, denying the possibility of traversing the entire graph starting from the same vertex, thereby preventing cycles. A DAG can be used as another form of DLT, maintaining the distributed ledger in a P2P manner, as does BC.

        <h4 id="BC3.0">2.2.1 - Blockchain 3.0: Scalability, Interoperability, Sustainability, Privacy, and Governance</h4>
        <p>There are many limitations with BC 1.0 and BC 2.0 prerequisite to bringing BC into widespread use. Most notably, scalability, interoperability, sustainability, privacy, and governance, which BC 3.0 aims to resolve. There are many competitors to that title, but as of yet, solutions are only theoretical as they are under construction. Some of the techniques designed to resolve these limitations, and BCs that are developing them, will be listed here.</p>
        <h5>Scalability</h5>
        <p>The most significant hindrance of BC’s largescale use is transaction speed: Bitcoin processes 7 transactions per second (tps), and Ethereum can process 20 tps. At the same time, PayPal can handle almost 200 tps, and VISAs claims to handle over 20,000.</p>
        <p>One way to increase transaction speed is through the use of sharding. Sharding has been used by giant databases worldwide since the late 1990s. It is a database partitioning technique that spreads the load over a decentralized network by portioning data through shards or horizontal portions of data. Essentially transactions would occur simultaneously and parallel on each shard could, horizontally scaling the tps. Blockchains using PoW cannot implement sharding. In the potential case of a PoW BC with 100 shards, a bad actor obtaining 1% hash power of the whole network could control 100% of a single shard. However, in a PoS BC, a malicious user must obtain over 50% of the cryptocurrency to initiate an attack. Thus, PoS chains are required for the use of sharding.</p>
        <p class="talj">One of the first BC platforms to implement sharding was Zilliqa <a id="link_Zilliqa_2017" href="#Zilliqa_2017">[Zilliqa_2017]</a>. During the testnet stage, the Zilliqa network could process over 2,800 tps. Phase 1 of Ethereum 2.0,  scheduled for sometime in 2021, will see the blockchain split up across a proposed 64 shards, increasing the throughput 100-fold. The Cardano BC announced its</p>
        <p class="ti0">scalability solution, Hydra protocol <a id="link_Chakravarty_2020" href="#Chakravarty_2020">[Chakravarty_2020]</a>, as part of their fourth era (Basho era). Each head of the Hydra protocol (each shard) can handle around 1,000 tps, resulting in the Cardano BC potentially reaching 1 million tps. The IOHK team, Cardano developers, introduced extended UTXO (EUTXO), an extension of Bitcoin’s UTXO model, allowing sharding of stake space without the need to shard the ledger itself.</p>
        <p>Additionally, several layer two fixes are being developed to integrate with existing blockchain protocols, allowing off-chain transactions on a P2P network to reduce on-chain bloat and increase throughput.</p>

        <p>Lightning Network is a layer two solution built for Bitcoin <a id="link_Poon_2015" href="#Poon_2015">[Poon_2015]</a>. However, Bitcoin only permits basic SCs, and while it is more scalable using Lightning Network, it is not a contender for the BC 3.0 title.</p>
        <p>Ethereum 2.0 has multiple types of layer two solutions, including Rollups (zk-Rollups and Optimistic rollups), Plasma, and others <a id="link_Wackerow_2021" href="#Wackerow_2021">[Wackerow_2021]</a>. Rollups allow transaction execution outside layer one, data or proof of transactions on layer one, and a rollup smart contract on layer one that enforces correct transaction execution through using the transaction data on layer one. Operators are required to stake a bond in the contract. Zk-rollups run computation off-chain and submit a validity proof to the chain. Optimistic rollups assume valid transactions and compute a fraud proof if challenged. Plasma allows layer two blocks on top of the Ethereum BC in the form of multiple side chains.  However, these plasma chains only support basic token transfers, swaps, and a few other predicate logic-based transaction types. <a id="link_Jones_2019" href="#Jones_2019">[Jones_2019]</a>.</p>
        <p>Hydra is Cardano’s layer two solution, allowing coins from multiple parties to be transferred to the second layer Hydra head for rapid processing. Once the head closes, the layer one redistributes the resulting location of the same quantity that was first transferred to the head when it opened. Hydra uses state channels that allow a smaller group of parties to agree on without interaction with the underlying BC. These state channels also enable the execution of SCs using as-is the SCs written on layer one.</p>
        <p>Another way to increase the throughput is to use a DAG in place of a BC. IOTA is designed for the Internet of Things (IoT), offering feeless transactions. IOTA’s transaction settlement and data integrity layer is called The Tangle. Instead of miners validating transactions, network participants are jointly responsible for transaction validation. Each new transaction must confirm two already submitted transactions to be validated. Every transaction requires computational resources based on PoW algorithms to find the answer to a simple cryptographic puzzle. IOTA currently requires a centralized coordinator node operated by the IOTA foundation. Since IOTA is still a small-scale project, it is uncertain whether it will be successful in practice.</p>
        <h5>Interoperability</h5>
        <p>To gain mainstream adoption, existing cryptocurrencies must work together. There are over four thousand blockchains, and communication between them is necessary. Interoperability can be attributed to the likely case that there will not be solely one BC in the end.  Numerous contenders, including Wanchain, Polkadot, and Cardano, are attempting different avenues for interoperability.</p>

<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <p>The goal is to present a mechanism to transfer data and assets between blockchains and legacy systems in a decentralized manner. As it is difficult for BCs to understand one another, significantly more so between any BC and legacy systems like banks, currently, exchanges are a centralized means of communicating between fragmented stores of value. These exchanges are fragile to being hacked or shut down to regulation incompatibility, and as such, are not a stable resource for a decentralized ecosystem. Thus, third-generation BCs must supply a means for reliable cross-chain transfers without needing a trusted third  party.</p>
        <p>Atomic swaps use a SC to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without centralized intermediaries (e.g., exchanges). This provides one way to exchange cryptocurrencies between the fragmented ecosystem of cryptocurrencies. However, this does not permit exchanges to legacy systems.</p>
        <p>Wrapped coins are a form of ERC-20 token, or fungible token, representing an asset (e.g., WBTC) with a similar price to that of the original asset (e.g., BTC) on another smart contract capable chain, so far Ethereum. Typically, a wrapped coin is backed one-to-one with the underlying asset or through a SC. Stable coins are one of the first types of wrapped assets, being fiat-backed (e.g., Tether (USDT)), which has its price pegged to the US dollar). Wanchain uses a similar procedure by locking tokens on the original chain and using proxy tokens for blockchain interoperability.</p>
        <p>Polkadot created a network protocol to transfer all data across public permissionless as well as private permissioned BCs. The relay chain, the heart of Polkadot, connects to Parachains, sovereign BCs, and Parathreads, economical BCs that don’t need continuous connectivity, using Bridges to connect and communicate. Polkadot does not have a SC platform itself. Instead, it links to Parachains that do, allowing full interoperability and data transfer between chains <a id="link_Polkadot_wiki" href="#Polkadot_wiki">[Polkadot_wiki]</a>.</p>
        <p>Interoperability between BCs is one matter; adding additional programming languages to the writing of SCs is another. The KEVM testnet was released in 2018, enabling a correct-by-construction version of the EVM specified in the K-framework. This allows SCs written for EVM to be rigorously proved that they work correctly and can be run on the Cardano BC. The Cardano BC SC layer is scheduled to be released in iterative stages from the end of April through September 2021. The testnet for Plutus SCs is expected at the end of April to early May, followed by Q&amp;A testing and creation of NFT marketplaces, etc. Around the end of June it will be feature-frozen for four weeks for partners (Coinbase, Binance, Yoroi, etc.) to integrate infrastructure before the hard-fork to mainnet.</p>

        <p>In September, the first version of the translator from LLVM to IELE without library support is scheduled. IELE is a K-framework mapping supporting a register-based virtual machine. The K-framework is a more mathematical higher-level mapping between the programming language and the LLVM lower-level / machine language mapping. The LLVM backend for K means that any programming language defined in K can be automatically translated to the LLVM. As IELE was defined in K, therefore, it has an automatic translation to LLVM. Essentially, through IELE, using any programming language directly, developers can write, compile and execute SCs <a id="link_IOHK_March2021" href="#IOHK_March2021">[IOHK_March2021]</a>.</p>
        
        <h5>Sustainability</h5>
        <p>BCs are not static and require further development to prevent becoming obsolete. A means to fund future developments is necessary for a worthy BC. ICOs are frequently used but are a finite means to generate a large flood of money. They depend on proper management by the team of developers, and there may be problems when the fund runs out. Patronage is another way that arguably leads to centralization, leading to an imbalance in the amount of influence over the system’s evolution and growth.</p>
        <p>Additionally, a treasury system can be used, allowing for a percentage of rewards to be sent to a decentralized account that can then be democratically distributed by funding proposals voted on by the token holders. The treasury model is robust. It provides an avenue to be refilled proportional to the currency’s size while providing democratic participation for stakeholders to choose what they think holds higher priority to strengthen the system. The challenges include:</p>
        <ol>
        	<li>Ensuring that the voting system is fair and proper.</li>
        	<li>Providing an incentive system to ensure voting.</li>
        	<li>Supplying an easy way to submit proposals with a sorting mechanism to separate the valuable ballots from the irrational ones.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And to meet all these challenges in a distributed manner that doesn’t necessitate centralized governance.</p>
        <p>A modularized treasury system compatible with most existing blockchains was designed and implemented by IOHK <a id="link_Zhang_2019" href="#Zhang_2019">[Zhang_2019]</a>, supporting liquid democracy and delegative voting for better collaborative intelligence. Cardano has this adapted in its Catalyst system, which is currently live, but it will be more fully developed in the Voltaire era (5 of 5). The five eras of the Cardano platform are being developed synchronously, so some pieces are already available.</p>

        <h5>Privacy</h5>
        <p>Most BCs are public permissionless, which means that the contents of wallets and their transactions are available for anyone to view online freely. This lack of privacy is of concern to some individuals and much more so to organizations and businesses.</p>
        <p>Several cryptocurrencies that take privacy as an imperative, including various degrees of anonymity: Monero, Dash, and Zcash. However, though these are not competitors to the BC 3.0 title, their privacy principles are being adapted into many contenders for the BC 3.0 title.</p>
        <p>Adapted from the core concept of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) and zk-Rollups offer a cryptographic privacy protocol proving ownership of a piece of knowledge without actually revealing it. For more, see <a href="#ZKP">Appendix A</a>.</p>
        <p>Ethereum 2.0 intends to use validity proofs in zk-rollups and Validium with data not stored on the main layer one.</p>
        <p>Cardano offers Sonic, a zk-SNARK, supporting a universal and continually updatable structured reference string that scales linearly in size. Sonic proofs are constant in size, and cost of verification is comparable with the most efficient SNARKs in literature <a id="link_Maller_2019" href="#Maller_2019">[Maller_2019]</a>. As Cardano’s SC capabilities (Goguen era: 3 of 5) will be released in the testnet stage at the end of April to early May 2021, Sonic must wait to be implemented.</p>
        
        <h5>Governance</h5>
        <p class="talj">The fifth and final stage of Cardano, the Voltaire era, will bring on-chain governance. Catalyst is one part of the Voltaire era that is already operational,</p>
        <p class="ti0">though Catalyst is mainly about treasury, mentioned previously, providing finances to build on Cardano. Voltaire is about creating governance for protocol updates, supplying the capacity to maintain and improve Cardano in a decentralized manner. Cardano is intended to be in the hands of the community, prospective completion 2025. The voting system is aimed to shift from the current system of Plutocracy to a hybrid of the current system and proof of merit.</p>
        <p class="talj">Polkadot provides a sophisticated governance system allowing it to evolve under the direction of the majority of its stakeholders. Changes are made to the network by combining votes of active token holders and the council, a fixed number of seats (expected to increase to 24). Anyone can propose a referendum to the council by depositing a</p>

        <p class="ti0">minimum number of tokens to support it. A proposal can be seconded by an agreeing member depositing the same number of tokens. The proposal with the highest amount of bonded tokens will be selected for inclusion as a referendum in the next voting cycle. There can only be a maximum of 100 public proposals in the proposal queue. There is also a council queue for proposals requiring a majority (51%) approval to be included as a referendum, with council members elected for the term of one week by token holders. One active referendum can be in progress at any given time, excluding the case of an emergency referendum - an accelerated proposal by the council or technical committee. The referendum is chosen as the top proposal, backed by the most bonded stake, and alternates between the two queues <a id="link_Governance-Polkadot_wiki" href="#Governance-Polkadot_wiki">[Governance-Polkadot_wiki]</a>.</p>

    	<h4 id="SSI_components">2.3 - SSI components</h4>
		<p>In the connected world of the Internet, digital identity has progressed from a centralized authority (e.g., IANA, ICANN) to administrative control by multiple federated authorities (e.g., Microsoft Passport, Liberty Alliance, Facebook Login, Google Login), and on to user-centric individual control (e.g., OpenID, OAuth, FIDO). The concept of a self-sovereign identity is now coming into attention, requiring that users be the ruler of their own identity <a href="#Allen_2016">[Allen_2016]</a>.</p>
        <p>SSIs are sometimes referred to as decentralized Identities. This paper will primarily use SSI unless the description prefers the other term. An SSI includes the following three components: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Identity Agents. Following will describe the different subsections in greater detail.</p>
        
        <h4 id="DIDs">2.3.1 - Decentralized identities</h4>
        <p>The W3C is outlining DIDs as a new type of identifier that enables verifiable decentralized digital identities <a id="link_Reed_2021" href="#Reed_2021">[Reed_2021]</a>. A DID controller decides the subject that the DID identifies (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, etc.). DIDs are designed to enable individuals and organizations to create and prove control over their own identifiers, rather than relying on management by centralized authorities.</p>
        <p>A DID is a globally unique URI to an identity: a web-accessible text string that resolves to a DID document (DIDdoc). The DID is a text string composed of three parts: the ‘did’ URI scheme identifier, the DID method’s identifier, and the DID method-specific identifier. Some DID method specifications currently in development can be found at.</p>

<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <p>DID generation and assertion are entity-controlled, leaving the number DIDs owned up to the needs and desires of the entity, allowing separation of identities, personas and interactions to at minimum the same degree capable in the real world. DIDs support interactions with other people, institutions, or systems that require identification, providing control over the degree of personal or private data revealed.</p>
        <p>The specifications do not demand any particular technology or cryptography for the generation, resolution, or interpretation of DIDs. Implementers can create DIDs based on identifiers from federated or centralized identity management systems, creating an interoperable bridge spanning the intersection between centralized, federated, and decentralized identifiers. Implementers also retain the capacity to design the specific types of DIDs demanded by the computing infrastructure they trust or use, following any standards defined by the W3C <a id="link_Steele_2020" href="#Steele_2020">[Steele_2020]</a>.</p>

            <p>A DID, as a URI, can also contain extra modifiers:</p>

            <p>Query: <code>did:example:1234...fghi?versionId=1</code></p>
            <p>Fragment: <code>did:example:1234...fghi#service=agent</code></p>
        </div>
    	<p>The DIDdoc that is resolved with the DID contains the ways to cryptographically authenticate a DID controller, a set of data describing the DID subject, and other information associated with the DID. DIDdocs are most often in the form JSON or JSON-LD. However, developers are permitted to use other forms, such as XML or YAML. In Example 1, under authentication, the encryption type is specified along with the public key to verify the DID.</p>

        <h4 id="VCs" style="margin-top:2em;">2.3.2 - Verifiable credentials</h4>
        <p>Credentials are routinely used in daily routines. Physical credentials such as driver's licenses, university degrees, government-issued passports, and local IDs are so much a part of life that without them, one is hampered—however, physical credentials lose credibility with online use.</p>
        <p>At present, expressing third-party verified education qualifications, healthcare data, financial account information, and even government ID info is untrusted, as validation that it is indeed the identified individual is imperfect at best. Thus, it is difficult to receive the same advantages on the Web that paper credentials offer in the physical world.</p>

        <p>VCs are a means to express credentials on the Web with the same advantages as a paper credential for the digital world, but in a way that is temper-resistant, cryptographically secure, and machine-verifiable, more trustworthy than their physical counterparts, respecting privacy as well. A VC includes a cryptographic signature of the issuer's authorship and cryptographic proof that the VC has not been revoked. A VC may contain an identifier and other metadata describing the credential’s properties <a id="link_Sporny_2019" href="#Sporny_2019">[Sporny_2019]</a>.</p>

        <p>An identity agent is a piece of software that enables an entity (person, organization, or thing) to execute one or more of the roles within the SSI infrastructure – issuer, holder, or verifier – allowing them to interact with others who also hold one of those roles. The main purpose of an identity agent is to handle verifiable credentials by offering an interface (e.g., mobile wallets) with which a holder can manage their identity.</p>

        	<li><b>Soundness:</b> Prover can only convince Verifier if they hold the knowledge.</li>
        	<li><b>Zero-knowledge:</b> Verifier does not learn anything about the knowledge, simply that the Prover has said knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a graphic illustration, the prover is given by a verifier a graph with nodes and edges and is tasked to find a 3-coloring such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. Imagine the verifier is an organization, and the prover is a freelancer. The prover finds a 3-coloring and must prove that they have done so without showing the result before getting paid.</p>
        <p>To construct an interactive ZKP protocol, the graph is drawn on the floor in a closed room. The prover, alone in the room, places colored balls on the nodes according to the discovered pattern and covers the balls with non-transparent bowls. At the prover’s confirmation that they are finished, the verifier comes into the room, chooses an edge, and verifies that the attached nodes are different colors, see Fig. 7. If they are not different the prover is disqualified.</p>

        <p>Since a single attempt by the verifier, checking adjacent nodes of one edge is not probabilistically certain, the verifier must be allowed as many checks till satisfaction. However, if the verifier were to record the colors and check all edges secretly, they would consequently have violated the zero-knowledge principle. To rectify this, the verifier must leave the room after validating an edge. The prover may then switch the colors of the balls, maintaining the pattern. Thus, proving that all edges chosen consistently have two different colored edges but maintaining zero knowledge of the exact pattern. This can be done until the verifier has certainty that there is only negligible error.</p>
        <p >The problem with traditional ZKP is that it is an interactive system, requiring the prover and the verifier’s presence, and as such is not scalable. Zk-SNARKs or zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge provides an algorithmic formation using cryptographic hash functions that does not require interaction.</p>
        <p class="ti0">The following algorithms were explained in <a id="link_Ivan_2020" href="#Ivan_2020">[Ivan_2020]</a>.</p>
        <p class="ti0">The three algorithms in zk-SNARK:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Prover (P): takes in three inputs – proving key (pk), a random input (x), and the statement to prove (s). Such that P(pk, x, s) = prf.</li>
        	<li>Verifier (V): takes in the random input (x), verifying key (vk), and prf from the P algorithm and returns a Boolean answer according to validity.</li> 
        	<li>Key Generator (G): takes in a secret value (&lambda;) and a program (C) to generate pk and vk. The lambda value has to be kept private and confidential as any holder could generate proving and verifying keys and build counterfeit proofs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ti0">The following steps utilize the above algorithms:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The verifier puts in a secret &lambda; value to generate the proving and verifying keys: G(C, &lambda;) = (pk, vk).</li>
        	<li>The prover must take the pk and prove their statement: prf = P(pk, x, s). Here x is the SHA-256 hash of s.</li>
        	<li>When prf is sent to the verifier and inserted into the verifying algorithm: V(vk, x, prf) = True if the prover is honest, False otherwise.</li>
        </ul>

    	<h4 id="IPFS_info">2.4.2 - InterPlanetary File System</h4>
        <p class="talj">HTTP is the protocol behind client-server architecture that we see in the internet of today. However, it has many drawbacks; in particular, the centralized nature of all information that we access to over the web is held on servers that are under control of a central company. This requires trust that the central company will not go offline either through an attack or simple server failure. It also enables censorship, as the data stored on a central server can be easily blocked by ISPs blocking the server’s IP. As all data is stored on the server, if the server goes down that data is no longer accessible.</p>
        <p>Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) introduces a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed file system, creating a system by combining a P2P BitTorrent swarm with a Git repository. IPFS forms a Merkle DAG data structure upon which one can build distributed versioned file systems, with no need for trust between nodes, thereby escaping a single point of failure(SPF). IPFS aims to replace HTTP by offering an enhanced web combining successful file distribution techniques invented in the past fifteen years <a id="link_Benet_2014" href="#Benet_2014">[Benet_2014]</a>.</p> 
        <p class="ti0">A summary of the successful techniques that IPFS incorporates:</p>
        <h5>Block Exchanges – BitTorrent</h5>
        <p class="ti0">BitTorrent <a id="link_Cohen_2003" href="#Cohen_2003">[Cohen_2003]</a> is a P2P filesharing system that coordinates untrusted peers (swarms) to distribute pieces of files collaboratively. Features from the BitTorrent ecosystem that IPFS assimilates include:</p> 
        <ul>
        	<li>BitTorrent’s data exchange protocol that rewards nodes who contribute to each other and punishes nodes who only leach.</li> 
        	<li>Bit Torrent peers track availability of file pieces and prioritize the rarest pieces to be downloaded first. This allows leaching peers (those that do not have a full copy) to be capable of trading with each other.</li>
        </ul> 
        <h5>Distributed Hash Tables</h5> 
        <p>Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) regulate and maintain metadata for P2P filesystems. BitTorrent uses MainlineDHT to track peers that are part of a torrent swarm.</p>

<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <h5>Version Control Systems – Git</h5> 
        <p>Version Control Systems model files changing over time and distribute all versions accurately. Git provides a Merkle DAG <a id="link_Becker_2008" href="#Becker_2008">[Becker_2008]</a> object model that captures changes to a file system tree. Files are objects that are content-addressed via a cryptographic hash of their contents. Links to other objects are embedded in a Merkle DAG. Versioning metadata, including branches and tags, are pointer references which are low in memory and thus easy to create and update. Version changes update references or add objects. Distributing version changes is a simple transfer of objects and update of remote references.</p>
        
        <h5>Self-Certified Filesystems – SFS</h5>
        <p>SFS proposed a global file system separated from key management. In SFS, file names contain the public keys thereby making them self-certifying pathnames. Key management occurs in user generated procedures outside the SFS file system, enabling a versatile file system with interchangeable key management mechanisms <a id="link_Mazières_1998" href="#Mazières_1998">[Mazières_1998,</a> <a id="link_Mazières_2000" href="#Mazières_2000">Mazières_2000]</a>. SFS allows distributed systems outside of centralized control <a href="#Merkle_1990">[Merkle_1990]</a>.</p>
        <p class="ti0">SFS introduced the following remote filesystem-addressing scheme:</p>
        <code>/sfs/&lt;Location&gt;:&lt;HostID&gt;</code> 
        <p class="ti0">where Location is the server network address and HostID = hash(PublicKey, Location).</p>
        <p>The name of an SFS file system certifies its server by offering the server’s public key that can be verified by the user. SFS instances have cryptographic namespace rather than one controlled by centralized authorities.</p>
        <h5>Content-Based addressing vs Location-Based addressing</h5>
        <p>In the web of today, individuals browse to a Location <span style="letter-spacing:-0.5px;">(e.g. https://www.someserver.com/somefile.html)</span> where they can access the information that is stored on the server, and their browser then stores a copy in their cache. Unless the Location points to a static file that some user has recently stored in their uncleared cache, that information will be unobtainable should the server go down.</p>
        <p class="talj">More significantly, if one user had a cached copy of a static file they would be unable to share it with another user without retrieving the static copy from their cache and</p>
	</section>
    <footer>?</footer>
</section><!-- END #.page.hf -->
<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <p class="ti0">hosting the copy on another server (dismissing copyright infringement). In the event that a user would re-host the file on a different server, the Location would be different, and thus would be inaccessible to any user who only had the Location of the unobtainable server.</p>
        <p>IPFS introduces Content-Based Addressing (CBA), also know as Name Driven Networking (NDN). With CBA when requesting a specific resource, the exact file by its hash (aka. fingerprint) is what is needed rather than the Location. When the IPFS network is asked for a file by a requester and someone on the IPFS network provides the resource, the resource will be copied to requester’s cache allowing the requester to provide a future requester the same content. This system will increase in speed should the file be shared amongst a larger quantity of nodes.</p>
        <p>The security ensuring that a file has not been tampered is the hash, or content name. When asking for a specific hash name, the file received can be checked to confirm that it has the same hash. If the hashes are equivalent, the file has not been altered.</p> 
        <p>IPFS also provides deduplication. If multiple users post the same file, it is stored only once in the IPFS network as it has the same hash. This improves efficiency across the network.</p>
        <h5>IPFS Design</h5>
        <p class="ti0">The IPFS protocol is a stack of sub-protocols that handle functionality <a href="#Benet_2014">[Benet_2014]</a>:</p>
        <ol>
        	<li><b>Identities</b> – node identity formation and validation</li> 
        	<li><b>Network</b> – administers connections between peers</li>
        	<li><b>Routing</b> – manages information to locate peers and objects</li>
        	<li><b>Exchange</b> – a block-exchange protocol (BitSwap) that conducts productive block distribution</li>
        	<li><b>Objects</b> – a Merkle DAG of links to content-addressed immutable objects</li>
        	<li><b>Files</b> – Git-like versioned file system</li>
        	<li><b>Naming</b> – self-certifying mutable name system</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Identities</h5> 
        <p>A cryptographic hash of a public key, NodeId, identifies nodes. Although users are able to reinitialize a new identity on each launch, they are incentivized to retain the same identity due to loss of accrued network benefits. On first connection, peers exchange public keys and check if the hash other.PublicKey is equal to other.NodeID.</p>

<section id="" class="page hf">

        <p class="ti0">Hash values are stored in multihash format:</p>
        <code>&lt;function code&gt;&lt;digest length&gt;&lt;digest bytes&gt;</code>
        <p>Multihash enables system flexibility to change function depending on the use case and allow for future upgrades.</p>
        <h5 style="margin-top:0;">Network</h5> 
        <p>IPFS connects hundreds of nodes in the network or across the internet.</p>
        <p class="ti0">Including features:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Transport:</b> using any transport protocol</li>
        	<li><b>Reliability:</b> using UTP if underlying networks do not supply another</li>
        	<li><b>Connectivity:</b> using ICE NAT traversal techniques</li>
        	<li><b>Integrity:</b> optionally checks messages against a hash checksum</li>
        	<li><b>Authenticity:</b> optionally digitally signs messages with sender’s private key</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Routing</h5> 
        <p>In order to provide nodes with connections to other peers’ objects and determine which peers can serve desired objects, IPFS uses a DSHT based on a combination of S/Kademlia and Coral. Values &lt;= 1KB are stored directly on the DHT, and for larger values a reference (NodeIds of peers who can serve the block) is stored on the DHT. </p>
        <p>IPFS uses BitSwap, based on BitTorrent, as a transport protocol for exchange. BitSwap peers have two sets of blocks ( {want_list}, {have_list} ). Contrary to BitTorrent, BitSwap is not limited to blocks in the same torrent. BitSwap operates as a marketplace for all blocks where nodes can acquire necessary blocks. Nodes barter in the marketplace for block exchange. See Filecoin [Filecoin] for current development. In basic use, peers must have blocks that its peers want in order for complementary exchange. This aims to incentivize nodes to cache rare pieces to use for exchange even if they have no need for the pieces directly.</p>
        <h5>Objects</h5> 
        <p class="ti0">IPFS builds a Merkle DAG with links between objects as cryptographic hashes. This provides:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Content addressing, with all content uniquely identified by its hash checksum.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <footer>?</footer>
</section><!-- END #.page.hf -->
<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <ul>
        	<li>Tamper resistance, with all content verified by its checksum and invalid or tampered data is rejected.</li>
        	<li>Deduplication, with all objects that have the same checksum stored only once.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each Object stores 256kb of data. An object can also contain a link to another IPFS Object, making it possible to store data that is larger than 265kb. A larger file would be broken into as many Objects necessary to hold the file size, and an Empty object linking to all the Objects that the file was broken into.</p>
        
        <h5>Files</h5> 
        <p class="ti0">IPFS defines a versioned filesystem on top of the Merkle DAG similar to Git:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><b>File Object:</b> blob – contains an addressable unit of data representing a file.</li>
        	<li><b>File Object:</b> list – represents a collection made up of IPFS blobs or list objects concatenated together. An IPFS list functions like a filesystem file with indirect blocks. Directed graphs where the same node appear in multiple places allows in-file deduplication.</li>
        	<li><b>File Object:</b> tree – represents a directory or map of names to hashes that represent blobs, lists, other trees, or commits.</li>
        	<li><b>File Object:</b> commit – represents a snapshot in the version history of an object.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Naming</h5> 
        <p>Inter Planetary Naming System (IPNS) tracks immutable IPFS objects with a mutable global namespace, following the naming scheme from SFS.</p> 
        <p>In IPFS, NodeId = hash(node.PubKey). Every user is assigned a mutable namespace ( <code>/ipns/&lt;NodeId&gt;</code> ) which enables them to publish an object signed by user’s private key. Other users can verify the object and confirm that it matches the public key and NodeId to verify the authenticity of mutable state retrieval.</p>
        <p>The separate prefix allows distinction between mutable (<code>ipns</code>) and immutable (<code>ipfs</code>) paths. The process follows publishing the object as an immutable IPFS object and then publishing its hash on the routing system as a metadata value. An optional commit object to store a version history is advised when necessary.</p>

    	<h4>Chapter 2 Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the broader class of distributed ledgers that include blockchain and directed acyclic graphs (DAG).</li>
            <li>DLT realizes 'a single version of truth' linked from the origin (genesis block) in a P2P network with no central authority.</li>
            <li>Distributed ledgers come with permissionless and permissioned validation (write) and public and private access (read).</li>
            <li>Blockchain is an append-only chain of transactions with each block header containing the previous block's hash.</li>
            <li>Blockchain block headers contain the Merkle hash of all transactions in the block body, providing validity to unchanged transactions.</li>
            <li>Blockchains are distributed and not controlled by any single party. Common means of consensus that ensure that nodes contain accurate information include PoW, PoS, DPoS, and BFT.</li>
            <li>A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a topological directed graph, ordered temporally forward, thereby eliminating loops.</li>
        	<li>Blockchain 1.0: cryptocurrency offering decentralized P2P transactions without a trusted third party.</li>
        	<li>Blockchain 2.0: smart contracts are Turing complete embedded terms and conditions via a programming language into cryptocurrency transactions.</li>
        	<li>Ethereum's EVM set the BC 2.0 stage with smart contracts growing more complex: Dapps, DAOs, DACs, and DASs.</li>
        	<li>Smart contracts in Ethereum have possible bugs: time order dependent contracts, timestamp dependent, mishandled exceptions, and reentrancy vulnerability.</li>
        	<li>Deterministic contracts are being developed: Ethereum 2.0's Python-like Vyper language;  Cardano's compiler Plutus, for on- and off-chain smart contracts written in Haskell - a purely functional programming language.</li>
        	<li>Blockchain 3.0: work in progress solving scalability, interoperability, sustainability, privacy, and governance for mainstream use of BC.</li>
        	<li>Scalability or transactions per second (tps) is a significant hindrance. Bitcoin processes 7tps and Ethereum can process 20tps while PayPal handles 200tps and VISA 20,000. Solutions include sharding, layer two fixes, and use of DAG instead of BC.</li>
        	<li>Interoperability between BCs is necessary for mainstream adoption.</li>
        	<li>Sustainability for ongoing funding of further development is necessary to prevent a BC from becoming obsolete.</li>

    	<ul>
        	<li>Privacy is vital as most BCs are public, permissionless, meaning all transactions and wallet amounts are visible to anyone. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) prove ownership of a piece of knowledge without disclosing the knowledge itself.</li>
        	<li>Governance allows a decentralized BC to be controlled via the democratic direction of stakeholders rather than a centralized authority.</li>
            <li>In the connected world of the Internet, digital identity has progressed from a centralized authority to federated authorities and user-centric individual control. The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystem is being created for individuals' full identity ownership without centralized authorization or control.</li>
            <li>An SSI (aka Decentralized Identities) is comprised of three components: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Identity Agents.</li>
            <li>The W3C is standardizing DIDs as a globally unique URI for an identity that resolves to a DID document containing ways to authenticate the DID controller cryptographically.</li>
            <li>VCs, also being standardized by the W3C, are a cryptographically secure, machine-verifiable set of claims about the holder.</li>
            <li>Claims from multiple VCs can be combined into a verifiable presentation to be presented to a verifier for cryptographic verification.</li>
<li>Identity Agents are interfaces (e.g., mobile wallets) that humans use to interact with their identity and manage DIDs and VCs.</li>
			<li>ZKPs were originally designed to be interactive proof systems having a Prover and a Verifier. The prover must prove a piece of knowledge (&lambda;) to the verifier without disclosing any more information than 'Prover knows &lambda;.'</li>
            <li>A ZKP must satisfy: Completeness - if the prover holds the knowledge and both parties correctly follow the protocol, the verifier can be eventually convinced without outside involvement. Soundness - the prover can only convince the verifier if they indeed hold the knowledge. Zero-Knowledge - the verifier learns nothing more than that the prover hold said knowledge.</li>
            <li>zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge) perform a similar zero-knowledge process using algorithms that is non-interactive.</li>
            <li>InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) uses content-based addressing (CBA), aka name-driven networking (NDN). IPFS is a collection of other file distribution techniques intended to offer an enhanced replacement for HTTP.</li>
            <li>In short, IPFS is a peer-to-peer (P2P) single BitTorrent swarm combined with a Git repository - creating a distributed versioned file system with no need for trust between nodes and escaping a single point of failure.</li>
            <li>IPFS uses self-certified pathnames with file names public keys.</li>

    	<h2 id="SoftwareDnD">Chapter 3 - Software design and development</h2>
        
        <p>SSI work is under active development by multiple parties and collectives. These include Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT), Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Sovrin, the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project,  the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Atala Prism by IOG (formerly known as IOHK), and others. Many participants and entities have added pieces to the construction of the SSI ecosystem.</p>
		<p>The SSI infrastructure has been formulating since 2015, but cryptography principles in the “Web of Trust” predated with Phil Zimmerman’s PGP 2.0 back in 1992. Through the use of BC and other DLT, we have decentralized, immutable timestamps attached to public and private key pairs, enabling the infrastructure on which to build SSI for use across the globe.</p>
        
        <h4 id="HyperledgerIDStack">3.1 - Hyperledger Identity Stack: Indy, Aries, and Ursa</h4>
        <p>The Linux Foundation set up the Hyperledger Project in 2015 to advance cross-industry collaboration in developing the performance and reliability of blockchains and distributed ledgers for non-cryptocurrency use. Hyperledger Indy (Indy) joined in 2017 as the first identity-focused blockchain framework. Indy’s code was contributed by the Sovrin Foundation, a global non-profit intending to provide a new standard for digital identities.</p> 
        <p>As Indy evolved, in 2018, the cryptography repository was migrated into its own project, Hyperledger Ursa (Ursa), to enable easier integration into other Hyperledger projects. Hyperledger Aries (Aries) was added in 2019 as a toolkit providing interoperability of agents using DIDs and VCs from multiple ecosystems. The Hyperledger Identity stack is a combination of Hyperledger Aries, where most developers will build on, on top of Hyperledger Indy, as an identity ledger. at the bottom are the cryptographic elements of Hyperledger Ursa.</p>
        <p>The Sovrin Network is a single global instance of Indy with nodes operated by a Sovrin Steward, an organization (company, government, university, etc.) that has made a legal agreement defining how they will operate their node within the rules defined by the Sovrin governance framework. The Sorvrin Foundation provides governance for the network, formulating the rules and upgrades of the nodes and overseeing the business and legal aspects of the network.</p>

        <p>Endorsers in the Sovrin Network are entrusted through reputation, legal agreements, and adherence to the Sovrin governance framework. Those they ‘anoint’ as other trusted known identities are solely granted permission to write to the public ledger. Indy was designed as a public permissioned ledger: anyone can read, but only a known few can write.</p>
        <p>As Indy is public, all data that is written to the BC is not private. Therefore, no individual’s VCs, DIDs, or other private data are permitted to be recorded to the ledger. Only credential issuers (e.g., governments, schools, etc.) need to write two, three, or four pieces of data to the ledger for a nominal cost <a id="link_Sovrin_2020" href="#Sovrin_2020">[Sovrin_2020]</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Public DIDs:</b> An issuer of a credential MUST have a DID recorded on the BC to allow verifiers to know who they are and why the credentials they issued can be trusted.</li>
            <li><b>Schemas:</b> A list of attribute names (fields) and their data types that a credential will have. A credential Issuer MAY put a new schema or use one that others already placed on the.</li>
            <li><b>Credential Definitions:</b> The DID of the issuer, the schema for the credentials, and the public keys (one per claim) used to sign the claims to issue a credential MUST be written to the BC.</li>
            <li><b>Revocation Registry:</b> The issuer MAY require the ability to revoke credentials, and if so, they must write a revocation registry to the ledger before issuing credentials. The revocation registry links to the credential definition, allowing the issuer to revoke credentials independent of the holders. The revoked credentials are not listed for public visibility, rather using ZKP, a holder can prove, and a verifier can verify that the holder’s unrevoked credential has not been revoked.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Identity holders can issue all their attributes on all credentials by creating ZKPs to prove attributes using one or more of the following means [Sovrin_2018]:</p>

    	<ul>
        	<li class="lstn">Example: [Do you live in Europe?] ZKP: [Country of residence is: a European country] or [Country of residence is: not in a European country]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With Aries as an open-source repository hosted by Hyperledger, the entire community has access to groundbreaking ZKP technology, not only those specific BCs that have them inbuilt. Through Aries other BCs using their own ledgers can take advantage of prebuild messaging using ZKPs and be compatible with others. Aries with ZKPs allows data sharing to be autonomous, which reduces the data hoarding problem by only needing to store what is necessary, avoiding data other than financial data being exploited for advertising.</p>
        <p>Aries is meant to be BC agnostic, and as mentioned above, Aries is what most developers will build on. An Aries agent is a piece of software that handles VCs for an entity (person, organization, or thing), allowing the holder to receive VCs from issuers and provide verifiable presentations to verifiers – a digital wallet. Agents use private, pairwise DIDs for every relationship, providing end-to-end encryption, allowing certain knowledge of who is on the other end of the connection.</p>
        <h5>Types of agents:</h5>
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Personal Agents/Edge Agents:</b> a mobile or PC app to establish connections and exchange messages such as offers of credentials and requests to prove claims from credentials. Personal agents could also be operated and run by a cloud service, but this would require trust in the service as it would have control of all keys.</li>
        	<li><b>Enterprise Agents:</b> run on servers to verify claims and issue credentials to clients. An enterprise will use VCs for received licenses and permits.  </li>
        	<li><b>Device Agents:</b> IoT devices can put sensor data into VCs to prevent tampering.</li>
        	<li><b>Routing Agent/Cloud Agents:</b> serve as intermediaries to facilitate the flow of encrypted messages between other types of agents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aries agents are divided into the following components: KMS, messaging interface, ledger interface, and controller.</p> 
        <p class="talj">An Aries agent has secure storage called the key management service (KMS) to store all information collected by the agent. An Aries KMS is wrapper code around a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) that contains DIDs, keys, credentials, etc., that are stored encrypted. The KMS key pair encrypts all other keys and data, and the KMS access key is protected by the app platform’s capable means (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.). For backup purposes, not only must the database be backed up, but the keys to decrypt the database entries must be backed up. These must be packaged, encrypted, and</p>

</section><!-- END #.page.hf -->
<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <p class="ti0">protected by a recovery key pair and must be held safely, separately from the backup until it is needed to restore. For possible ways to manage backup and recovery key storage, see <a id="RecoveryKeyManagement" href="link_RecoveryKeyManagement">Appendix C</a>.</p>
        <p>Aries uses transport-agnostic DID Communication (DIDComm) messaging protocols to enable P2P messaging. The message is encrypted via Ursa and assembled into a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure by the DIDComm envelope protocol and decrypted at the other end by the intended recipient.</p>
        <p>The Aries ledger interface is pluggable, allowing an Aries agent to interact with multiple ledgers and VC ecosystems. However, Indy is the only ledger interface implementation currently.</p>
        <p>The controller provides the rules defining what actions the agent initiates and how it will respond to events. In a mobile agent, the controller is a user interface presenting the options to a person. An issuer/verifier enterprise agent might be a legacy database system that manages consumer data, potentially enabling customers to submit data by presenting claims rather than typing the information in a web form.</p>
        <p>For development, an Aries Agent can be divided into two logical components: framework and controller. The framework corresponds to the standard capabilities provided to enable the Aries agent to interact with its surroundings: ledgers, storage, and other agents. The controller is the customizable component designed to handle rules for that particular agent.</p>
        <p>Aries frameworks for edge development are currently available in .NET <a id="link_Hyperledger_Aries-framework-dotnet" href="#Hyperledger_Aries-framework-dotnet">[Hyperledger_Aries-framework-dotnet]</a> and golang <a id="link_Hyperledger_Aries-framework-go" href="#Hyperledger_Aries-framework-go">[Hyperledger_Aries-framework-go]</a>, and there is work on Java and JavaScript based. For cloud development that is not designed for mobile devices is available in Python: Aries Cloud Agent Python <a id="link_Hyperledger_ACA-Py" href="#Hyperledger_ACA-Py">[Hyperledger_ACA-Py]</a>. The frameworks for edge development are embedded in the controller enabling the use of DIDComm and other Aries protocols.</p> 
        <p>Aries Cloud Agent Python can be accessed through an Open-API/Swagger UI, allowing manual simulation of a connection between Faber college and Alice <a id="link_Hyperledger_AriesOpenAPIDemo" href="#Hyperledger_AriesOpenAPIDemo">[Hyperledger_AriesOpenAPIDemo]</a>. The ledger used in this demo is the GreenLight Dev Ledger, an open public ledger contributed and operated by the Province of British Columbia <a id="link_Greenlight" href="#Greenlight">[Greenlight]</a>. The protocols for connection can be seen in Fig. 8, followed by Faber sending Alice an invitation in Fig. 9 and Alice receiving the invitation in Fig. `0.</p>

        <ol>
        	<li>The device itself</li>

        	<li>Another device</li>
        	<li>Peer-to-peer files</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The device itself is an easy location to store the encrypted backup. The device agent would initiate an incremental backup of the KMS database. This has an advantage for easy restoration should there be a problem with the wallet app and prepackaging in advance of external (cloud agent) backup. The disadvantage is primarily if the device is lost or irreparably damaged.</p>
        <p>In the case of a mobile provider, the cloud agent would be an obvious place to store an encrypted backup. The potential risk lies in the cloud agent service operator having access to the data, even in encrypted form, as they could work on cracking the encryption. Alternatively, a separate trusted service such as a bank could potentially offer such services.</p>
        <p>Another device or other hardware that you own or one controlled by a trusted other could be a valid backup. This could provide a recourse should your primary device be lost or broken.</p>
        <p>Parts of the backup could be redundantly distributed to different backup holders via a P2P sharing technique, requiring collecting a certain number of the redundant files to restore the backup on the target device.</p>

        <p class="ti0">Recovery key management is as essential as a reliable backup location. Locations to store include:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Hot storage – on device: protected via hardware provided protection like biometrics. This would prove moot should the device be lost.</li>
        	<li style="talj">Cold storage – on paper or USB flashdisk: stored to a device that is not online, eliminating remote access by an attacker. On paper could be risky as, over time, the ink may fade. Storage on a USB key could be sufficient, though finding a safe place to store it may be an issue in itself. A bank deposit box or keeping a sealed  copy with</li>
            <li class="lstn">a lawyer is a possibility that may be costly. Keeping a copy at work or with a friend/family member or two is another alternative. Though the more copies around, the higher the risk of unauthorized use.</li>
        	<li>Sharded hot storage – social recovery: a novel proposal to shard the key into pieces and distribute the pieces amongst a set of holders, requiring only a decided subset of the pieces to combine for full key restoration - see passguardian.com.</li>
        	<li>Memorizing: this may be difficult to retain as the key must be sufficiently long and random to be effective.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Should all backups and recovery techniques fail or not exist, the wallet would be gone. In that case, a new wallet must be created and all credentials recollected from the various issuers. Presumedly the first credential would be a governmental ID and a degree of hassle and time to get the others in order of importance. Thus, multiple safe backups are necessary.</p>
        
		<h4 id="AtalaPrism">3.2 - Atala Prism</h4>
        <p>Atala, an enterprise BC framework similar to Hyperledger Fabric used by IBM BC, was developed by IOHK to onboard governments in developing countries. Atala was built to handle real-world use cases such as property registration, voting systems, and supply chain management, focusing on digital currency adoption. Starting with Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, MoUs have been signed to create a digital payment system, allowing six million users to pay power and electricity bills with cryptocurrency, eventually combining this system with an identity card <a id="link_Wolfson_2019" href="#Wolfson_2019">[Wolfson_2019]</a>. In the Republic of Georgia, Atala is teaming up with the Ministry of Education and universities to enable students to receive, store and send their achievements from their phones. This eliminates the need for background checks and saves time for universities and employers.</p>

        <p>As enterprises and governments want more control over data for legal and regulatory reasons, Atala was developed as a permissioned system based on Cardano. Cardano, in its initial era (Byron era), was a permissioned system. Currently, Atala focuses on layer two solutions such as Prism for SSI and economic identity, Hydra for scaling, and more. These layer two solutions are blockchain agnostic, and as such, can be used on both permissioned (Atala) and permissionless (Cardano). As both Atala and Cardano use the same underlying infrastructure similar, when Cardano improves, Atala will also improve through downstream contributions such as the EUTXO model and Plutus SCs. IOHK is working with the Hyperledger Foundation to onboard Gerolamo, a unification of permissioned and permissionless chains for fluid portability between enterprise and public usage of the Cardano BC <a id="link_Hoskinson_2020" href="#Hoskinson_2020">[Hoskinson_2020]</a>.</p>
        <p>The Cardano and Atala teams aim to provide the technology for digital identity to bank the unbanked and offer the means for developing countries to leapfrog legacy systems directly to the integrated digital world. In banking the unbanked and giving them access to a cryptocurrency for authenticating the supply chain, there comes an avenue to supply loans to local farmers and others.</p>
        <p>Atala Prism is still under development, and the code has not yet been released open-source <a id="link_IOHK_January2021" href="#IOHK_January2021">[IOHK_January2021]</a>. The following is the available demonstration part online, part on a mobile device <a id="link_IOHK_AtalaPrism" href="#IOHK_AtalaPrism">[IOHK_AtalaPrism]</a>, and it is a good demonstration, from a user's perspective,  of the intended ease of working with SSI .</p>

        <p>When the mobile app is installed on a phone, there is an initial seed phrase of 12 words you are instructed to save. If the phone is lost or broken, it is the only way to recover the account. If the seed phrase is lost, all contacts and VCs will have to be collected from scratch.</p>
		<p>The demonstration follows the process for Jo to get four credentials: Government ID, University Degree, Proof of Employment, and Health Insurance. In the initial steps concatenated in Figure 12, a QR code is provided to be scanned by the mobile app Atala Prism. After scanning, on the mobile device is a confirmation to accept connection with the Metropol City Government.

        <p>The DIF has been focused on the open-source development of specifications and standards for protocols, components, and data formats for industry-wide collaboration in decentralized identity / SSI construction. In the DIF, working groups collaborate on defining the standard specifications for the following areas <a id="link_DIF" href="#DIF">[DIF]</a>:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Identifiers and Discovery:</b> Universal Resolver &amp; Registrar</li>
        	<li><b>Authentication:</b> DID-based authentication specs</li>
        	<li><b>Claims and Credentials:</b> DID Credential Manifest</li>
        	<li><b>DID Communication:</b> creating a standardized means of authenticated message passing P2P between DID controllers (furthering the work by Hyperledger Aries)</li>
        	<li><b>Sidetree:</b> blockchain agnostic, layer two, DID Method <a id="link_DIF_Sidetree" href="#DIF_Sidetree">[DIF_Sidetree]</a></li>
        	<li><b>Secure Data Storage:</b> formulizing specifications for a foundational secure data storage layer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The majority of the content from the above working groups is standardization. However, one notable contribution comes in the form of a Universal Resolver (UR). The UR is a foundational piece of infrastructure for the SSI ecosystem by resolving the DIDdoc from a supplied DID <a id="link_Sabadello_2021" href="#Sabadello_2021">[Sabadello_2021]</a>.</p>
        <p>Currently, the development UR (https://dev.uniresolver.io) can resolve 42 DID Methods. This is not intended for more than development use, as being on a single server, the dev UR centralizes an intended decentralized infrastructure. When the SSI ecosystem is closer to final development, multiple servers will offer their own UR. The universal resolver protocol and appropriate drives are intended to be downloaded and run on more instances to maintain the distributed nature of the SSI ecosystem <a id="link_DIF_Universal_Resolver" href="#DIF_Universal_Resolver">[DIF_Universal_Resolver]</a>.</p>
		<p>Another prominent project from DIF is Sidetree, a BC agnostic layer two protocol for PKI. The Sidetree protocol defines state change operations (i.e., Create, Read, Update, or Deactivate) to mutate a DID’s DIDdoc. Sidetree nodes anchor Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) references to the underlying anchoring system (e.g., DLT), offering an immutable chronology that all nodes can validate.</p>
        <p class="talj">Building on Sidetree, Microsoft, a member of DIF, has been working on ION <a id="link_DIF_ION" href="#DIF_ION">[DIF_ION]</a>. ION uses Bitcoin as the underlying DLT and uses IPFS (see appendix 3) for CAS storage of DID operations (Fig. 14). Since ION nodes process transactions on layer two, it is possible to anchor tens of thousands of DID/DPKI operations in a single on-chain</p>

        <p>One primary avenue that Microsoft is offering for ION implementation is with its Azure Active Directory, currently available as a preview under the description of "Decentralized Identity" or "Active Directory Verifiable Credentials."</p>
        <p class="ti0">Their SSI foundation is made up of several key components:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>W3C's DIDs</li>
            <li>ION (Identity Overlay Network)</li>
            <li>DID User-Agent/Wallet</li>
            <li>Microsoft Resolver</li>
            <li>Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials Service</li>
		</ol>
        <p>The DIDs, as per the W3C's specifications, are user created, owned, and controlled, are globally unique identifiers linked to DPKI metadata comprised of JSON DIDdocs containing public keys, authentication descriptors, and service endpoints. </p>
        <p>ION is a layer-two open-source, public permissionless network based on the blockchain agnostic, deterministic, Sidetree protocol. ION and Sidetree have no tokens, trusted validators, or consensus mechanisms, relying solely on Bitcoin-core's time chain. Capabilities include creating new DIDs, generating corresponding keys, and anchoring DIDs on the Bitcoin core BC.</p>
        <p>The DID User-Agent offered is the Microsoft Authenticator App. The Authenticator app allows the creation of DIDs and manages the issuance and presentation of VCs. Backup of DID seeds in an encrypted wallet file is also possible.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Resolver is an API performing lookup and resolution of DIDs using the <code>ion</code> DID method, returning the corresponding DIDdoc.</p>
        <p>The Azure Active Directory Verifiable Credentials Service supplies an open-source SDK for issuance and verification of VCs signed with the <code>did:ion</code> method, allowing identity owners to generate, present, and verify claims.</p>

    	<h2 id="SSI_furtherUses">Chapter 4 - Potential further uses of SSI</h2>
        
    	<h4 id="originalPlan">My untested original plan</h4>
    	<p>Anticipating claims that there would be a decentralized identifier system/ SSI system available to build on top of in Q4 2020, I structured plans to take it further and create a decentralized rating system. The idea was to start with a nonsensitive topic: movie ratings.</p>
        <p>The ratings would be submitted with K-anonymity to the degree desired by the user, contributing to the privacy of the rater. The ratings would have attached user-chosen categories that would otherwise be personally identifiable information (PII). Categories such as age bracket (0-9, 10-19, …, 90-99, or even more general ones: &lt;21, &lt;50, &gt;50), nationality, country of residence, occupation, and even more abstract groups such as ‘nerd,’ ‘jock,’ ‘cheerleader,’ ‘soccer mom,’ ‘extrovert,’ ‘introvert,’ ‘trendy,’ ‘armchair philosopher,’  etc. All available categories could be added to the rating if a user had a VC certifying membership in that category. The assumption being that users would be more willing to add multiple categories to their rating were the ratings not linked to a targetable identifier like an email address or social media account name.</p>
        <p>The ratings with those added categories would be added to logs calculating the totals of viewer appreciation from all different groups at the rater's consent. These logs would be made publicly available both on IPFS and HTTP.</p>
        <p>From a larger perspective, ratings of this type would provide a new scheme of video recommendation. Based on user choice, rather than concentrating on what they have previously seen, or tailored to them as an individual, allows decentralized open-source big data that users could query. This does not prevent any user from sticking in a particular group, but in the case of a group event, this new scheme could be used to add categories of all participants and narrow the list to ones that all should like. This new rating scheme could also be used for exploring new genres or exploring what someone on the other side of the world would be interested in out of curiosity.</p>
        <p class="talj">This rating system template could then be used for other areas, such as shopping, clothing preferences, and more. The primary purpose for designing this rating system is to open knowledge for academic purposes, businesses, and ordinary individuals. This type of</p>

        <p class="ti0">uncontroversial knowledge-gathering could allow similarities to be demonstrated in humans globally or enable people to be more open to encountering people outside of their area of familiarity.</p>
        
    	<h5>Original plan</h5>
        <p class="ti0">The original plan asked the following three questions with anticipated, hypothetical answers:</p>
        <p><b>Question 1:</b> Is it possible to create a grouping system on IPFS for semi-anonymous data aggregation?</p>
        <p><b>Hypothesis 1:</b> Yes. IPFS creates its own distributed data storage with namespacing by hash-key. Using a newly generated keypair gives pseudonymity to the user as long as they don’t identify their public key on social medial.</p>
        <p><b>Question 2:</b> Is there a way to pull ratings to user-chosen groups where rating totals for each group can be seen?</p>
        <p><b>Hypothesis 2:</b> Yes. This can be done through IPFS groupings pulled and stored by all group members. A copy could potentially be stored on a NoSQL database. An HTTP homepage that pulls data from IPFS could be created.</p>
        <p><b>Question 3:</b> Can an SSI mechanism be created to collect and distribute ratings to user-chosen groups?</p>
        <p><b>Hypothesis 3:</b> The SSI frameworks scheduled to be released in late 2020 should have the functionality to develop the necessary structures.</p>
        
        <p class="ti0">The initially planned methodology to test hypothesis 1 &amp; 2:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Create sample user ratings on IPFS (sourced from grouplens.org, randomly selecting groups to attribute to each anonymized rating)</li>
            <li>Create sample groups and a group template on IPFS</li>
            <li>Creation of pages for group totals</li>
            <li>Creation of homepage for groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ti0">The methodology for hypothesis 3, presuming that 1 and 2 were satisfied:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create SSI interface for rating collection</li>
            <li>Include means for group selection in SSI interface</li>
        </ul>

    	<h5>Required changes to original idea</h5>
    	<p>The SSI ecosystem was not built to the degree required in time for this thesis. After exploring in-depth, with the available information, the three forerunners mentioned in chapter 3, several points in the original idea should be revised before this proposal is constructed.</p>
    	<p>First, rather than adding a protocol to supply the K-anonymity, the use of uncorrelatable, pairwise DIDs would allow the user a degree of anonymity. If the rater is concerned with being targeted, they should not add too specific a location (e.g., one with a small population) as a group. This may not be of concern to many people but is a safety mechanism for those who may be targeted for some differences they hold.</p>
    	<p class="talj">Next, the idea to use IPFS is not quite as anonymous as expected. Originally the understanding was that all NodeIDs were simply a public key and thereby as pseudonymous as most BCs. However, like public BCs that do not use ZKP (e.g., Bitcoin) where IP addresses can be traced in explorers,  IPFS’s DHT stores the IP address of every user’s PeerID <a id="link_IPFS" href="#IPFS">[IPFS]</a>. This could allow targetability for the original rater and all who store</p>

        <p class="ti0">the content hash (CID). This could be of concern as data profiling would still be possible by ISPs and other unidentified profiling organizations, which would go contrary to the GDPR standards, or other hackers who may have personal or paid interest to target a particular group. Although IPFS is still in its early formulation and may resolve these issues later, as of now, it is not anonymous enough. Thus Hypothesis 1 is contradicted.</p>
        <p>One possible way to resolve this would be to make an HTTP page where the logs would originally be totaled. Rather than storing the individual ratings on IPFS, instead, allow timestamped query results from the HTTP totals page to be exported to NoSQL and stored on IPFS. Any individual that wishes to maintain their privacy can store a copy of multiple query results on their IPFS, so even if their IP is available, targeting them would be a matter of speculation that they hold membership in any of those groups. Thus Question, and Hypothesis 2, could be applicably adjusted, and Question 1 could be reformulated.</p>
        <p>Finally, in regards to Question 3, there are demonstrations (i.e., Atala Prism) of using SSI to register DIDs, accept and request VCs, and use said VCs to prove necessary claims. However, as to this point, Atala Prism is only available as a demonstration model, not one that can be used to develop on top of. Other privacy principles, such as pairwise DIDs that Hyperledger Identity Stack recommends, cannot be confirmed that Atala Prism implements. Although there are claims that Atala is open-source, the code is not yet released for public access. Hyperledger Aries is working on the underlying DIDcomm, but there are no available GUIs yet. Although the DIDcomm protocols already defined could presumably be used to simulate the concept of submitting a rating as simple text with claims attached, it would be far too primitive and take too much time to do in time for a master’s thesis. ION claims to have released a basic framework at the end of March, but that release was too late to provide enough time to develop on top of it.</p>
        <p>Further, SSIs, or DIDs, are not specific for human individuals but for things and organizations too. Another proposal would be to give each film its own DID to which ratings would be attached. This could be advantageous for a film to demonstrate acclaim among different audiences. The disadvantage would be that with an SSI, the ratings would be at the disclosure of the controller of that SSI, so the controller may choose not to release all reviews, only the positive ones. Since SSIs are linked to a public BC, there may be ways to compare the total of data transactions to the film's DID to the total amounts of votes displayed. However, there are many ways the film's SSI controller could excuse this without permitting full transparency.</p>

    	<h4 id="SSI_underDevelopment">4.2 - SSI extensions under development</h4>
        <p>SSIs go beyond simply providing entities with a digital identity. A digital identity is a solid foundation for improved digital versions of legacy paper documents and trusted solutions for the global economy. The following section will explore several pathways under development.</p>
        <h5>Education</h5>
        <p>The issuance of academic certification is centralized by each school. If a diploma, degree, or other credential is lost or damaged, it is typically costly to request a replacement. What if the issuing institute no longer exists? The original copy or a re-issued one, being on paper, are difficult to share when needed and almost certainly require an in-person visit. On behalf of the verifier, verification of the academic certificate is time-consuming at best or impossible if the issuing institute is no longer in business.</p>
        <p>These issues can be resolved through the use of an SSI. All credentials issued by an institute would be signed with the public key of that institute, which presumably would be publicly notified on a DLT. This would allow all issued certificates to be verifiable even after the institute ends business. Credentials could also be checked for non-revocation without requiring contact with the issuing institution.</p>
        <p>Even better, as demonstrated by Cardano's Atala Prism working with the Ethiopian Minister of Education, a next-generation blockchain-based solution can track grades and educational attainments of (starting with 5 million) students from kindergarten to 12th grade. Several applications and web-based applications would be built, allowing the ministry of education and school(s) to monitor the students. These applications could view what credentials have been issued to them, track the student's progress in certain subjects, monitor their attendance, and store all the certificates and data in the unique SSI of the student. This storage in the SSI of the student gives the student full ownership and control of their academic achievements, enabling easy sharing with universities or employment after graduation [<a id="link_IOHK_April2021" href="#IOHK_April2021">IOHK_April2021</a>].</p>
        <p>Common use of this sort of academic monitoring could also be applied to teachers, discovering their pedantic methodologies and related student success. This could potentially be tailored to connect students with teachers who use methods favorable for the positive advancement of the student, the field, and even the nation and beyond.</p>

<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
    	<h5>Banking and financial services</h5>
        <p>With regulations on one side and customer's demand for speedy, fully digital experience on the other - in more developed cities and countries - the benefits of migrating to use the SSI ecosystem are evident.</p>
        <p>Efficient onboarding for new customers with verifiable KYC - client's conditional disclosure of some or all of their financial history - becomes quick and cheap. Speed of onboarding is guaranteed as rather than expending time and resources tracing a scattered paper trail, there is a readily available distributed, cryptographically guaranteed, and timestamped immutable digital record. The lower operational costs are due to eliminating the paper trail and associated time and resource expenses. Traceable and auditable PII processing should reduce regulatory liability and compliance costs while enhancing client experience and convenient access to a broader selection of financial products.</p>
        
        <h5>Retail and E-commerce</h5>
        <p>There is an increasing trend of counterfeit goods being marketed, primarily online. Anti-counterfeiting measures are often lengthy and often are on a per-case basis, doing little to curb the ongoing sale of counterfeit items as most fakes are sold online by traders with low risk for indictment. This can lead to substantial financial losses for buyers and manufacturers, damage to brand reputation, and decreased customer confidence。</p>
        <p>VeChain offers a combination of the use of blockchain and a Smart Tag such as an RFID tag or QR Code to trace a retail product's lifecycle, allowing customers to verify the products are authentic before purchase. The data at each stage is verified by an independent third party who uploads the data to the immutable blockchain, thus guaranteeing authenticity for the downstream companies and customers. The VeChain Pro App can be used to scan the Smart Tag, allowing the user to trace and verify the product. This essentially performs the procedure of supplying an SSI for the product.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of the use of SSI on the retail distributor or E-commerce app or site would be reduced storage of customers' PII, keeping the minimum needed to recognize the customer at a future visit. Including a VC listing ownership of the Smart-Tag ID would be an additional step that could be implemented, allowing legal ownership verification in the case of a dispute.</p>

<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <h5>Supply chain tracking</h5>
        <p>Including SSI into marketable products can enable customers to trace the source, conditions in production, and all ingredients before purchase. When brands use green or sustainable production, this could be clearly visible and verifiable by the buyer. A constant and reliable supply chain with all shipping conditions and exchanges immutably recorded on a BC is one piece that is necessary for this to be provided to the end customer.</p>
        <p>Agriculture is one category whose supply chain must progress continually for the growers' livelihoods and the sustenance of the eaters while being transported under specific stipulations. Meat and dairy products are another division where the shipping conditions are even more stringent to avoid resulting in consumer death. The farming conditions for products labeled organic should also be visible to the end consumer.</p>
        <p>Today's trade is still mostly based on paper documents in siloed data centers, with each step having its own system of paperwork. Farmers, haulers, retailers, and end consumers can all use BC for product certification and traceability and have their own SSI to collect and store reputation and compliance with regulations over time.</p>
        <p>VeChain, IOTA, and Atala Trace are among those working to revitalize the supply chain system through different products and initiatives.</p>
        
        <h5>Health care</h5>
        <p>There are numerous advantages SSI use can bring to medical care, including certifying that medicines are legit and not counterfeit, protecting patients' PII data, confirming that a doctor's qualifications are up to date, and more.</p>
        <p>Due to cost, peer pressure, or other reasons, people purchase medications online. Similar to E-commerce mentioned above, online sales are less regulated and easier to abuse, and counterfeit or substandard medications are another dilemma that not only inflicts financial losses but affects people's health as well. The use of SSI tracking schemes such as Atala SCAN or VeChain Smart Tags could reduce the risk and improve the well-being of patients globally.</p>
		<p>A patient can use Doctors' SSI certification to confirm that the doctor is qualified in the desired field and also ensure that the licensing is by a notable medical authority.</p>
        <p class="talj">Patients' PII kept safe through the use of SSI is one advantage. Storing the patient's entire medical record under their control allows the ease of transporting it between doctors,</p>
	</section>
    <footer>?</footer>
</section><!-- END #.page.hf -->
<section id="" class="page hf">
	<section>
        <p class="ti0">locations, hospitals, cities, or even countries, escaping the siloed healthcare record system that currently exists. This is a tremendous advantage for the patients, as their medical data is consolidated and under their control.</p>
        <p>The use of SSI can, most certainly, revolutionize the health care industry. Cryptographically authenticated anonymous statistics of the success of medicines and medical procedures could also be gathered to improve doctor recommendations and indirectly improve medicine research if currently used approaches could be improved.</p>
        
        <h5>IoT</h5>
        <p>Attaching DIDs to items allows many enhancements, including streamlined automation in smart factories, traffic management, carbon reduction credits, and more.</p>
        <p>Many IoT devices will have low computational resources and storage. These devices could have embedded Smart Tags or QR codes and rely on external data processing combined from multiple edge devices. For example, in a smart home, not all smart devices are required to do their processing independently. Instead, a smart-home-hub could gather, collectively manipulate and secure the data supplied by the discrete devices. Alternatively, all data could be tied to the owner's SSI mandating the owner's consent for visibility or manipulation of any data.</p>
        <p>IOTA proposes advancing into Industry 4.0 whereby intelligent connected machines can self-organize, self-optimize, and develop into cross-company value chains with reliable, transparent data exchange. Devices can securely communicate and exchange data, goods, and services, leaving an immutable audit trail for administrative purposes.</p>
        <p>VeChain advances a solution to encourage consumers to participate in carbon reduction, earning carbon reduction credits as a reward. This proposal comes as a result of traditional carbon reduction being mainly top-down administrative orders. Incentivising enterprises and consumers to favor the use of new energy vehicles, energy-efficient appliances, and so on through tagging these devices with Smart Tags and storing carbon reduction data on the BC, granting the responsible target carbon reduction credits.</p>
        <p>Embedding DIDs into vehicles could be used to regulate traffic, give priority to emergency vehicles, and more. When self-driving cars come into use, traffic management as a whole could be operated transparently via DLT. <a id="link_Bagloee_2019" href="#Bagloee_2019">[Bagloee_2019]</a> formulates and numerically tests the concept of a smart-contract-based tradable mobility permit, exploring the side benefits it produces.</p>

        <p>There are many more use cases for tying SSI to IoT devices, enough to write an entire paper.  Allow this passage to whet the appetite for what the future can bring.</p>
        
        <h4>Chapter 4 Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>My original plan was to build an anonymized rating system for films on top of SSI.</li>
            <li>This rating system would provide a new video recommendation system based on user selection rather than tailored to what they have previously seen or what similar viewers like.</li>
            <li>IPFS' NodeIDs are public keys and thereby pseudonymous. However, IPFS's distributed hash table (DHT) records IP addresses of all PeerIDs, thereby nullifying any pseudonymity.</li>
            <li>The SSI ecosystem goes beyond providing entities with a digital identity.</li>
            <li>Education uses include collecting all educational data, attendance, and certificates embedded in a student-owned digital device for easy future use with higher education or employment.</li>
            <li>In banking and financial services, there is the ease of onboarding new customers through immutable storage and cryptographic verifiability of all past financial history. An immutable, auditable trail is available for regulatory compliance.</li>
            <li>Solving anti-counterfeiting through QR tagging or embedding RFID with DIDs can increase customer confidence and reduce financial losses for buyers and manufacturers.</li>
            <li>Supply train tracking and recording all data on a blockchain offers a uniform tracking format from the factory to the vendor, allowing the consumer to see all ingredients and conditions in manufacture and shipping.</li>
            <li>Supply train tracking for consumables could document for the buyer the degree of sustainable farming and the conditions in transport (e.g., was the meat kept consistently below a necessary temperature).</li>
            <li>In health care, anti-counterfeiting medicine (particularly if purchased online), patient PII data protection, doctor qualification with updated licenses, and patient data portability between locations are among the solutions that can be built on the SSI ecosystem.</li>
            <li>With IoT, automated smart factories could dynamically process devices, gathering necessary materials cross-company, and leave an immutable audit trail.</li>
            <li>A pathway for incentivizing participation in becoming carbon neutral was presented by VeChain. Smart Tags can be embedded in low-carbon IoT devices to generate carbon reduction credits for the owner's use.
Embedding DIDs in vehicles could allow automated traffic management.</li>

    	<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The SSI ecosystem being developed will bring significant changes to digital identity. Through the use of DLT, we have the technological infrastructure on which to build decentralized identities. On the one hand, decentralized identities place control back into the hands of the identity holders or controllers in the case of non-animate subjects, and on the other hand, allow verifiable traceability for identity data. Verifiable traceability improves big data quality from its collection in centralized, unverifiable islands to one that is straight from the source with consent receipts attached.</p>
        <p>This paper presented the fundamental principles of Distributed Ledger Technology, Blockchain, Blockchain means of consensus, and blockchain’s generations: cryptocurrency (BC 1.0), smart contracts (BC 2.0), and ongoing improvements in scalability, interoperability, sustainability, privacy, and governance (BC 3.0). This paper also described Self-Sovereign Identities, SSI subsections: Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, and Identity Agents, GDPR data protection regulations, and SSI work in progress: Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries, Atala Prism, and DIF member Microsoft’s ION.</p>
        <p>In future research, when the SSI infrastructure has developed further, exploration of uncorrelatable links to SSI claims through ZKP can be used to store knowledge of preferences in a globally accessible way (e.g., movie ratings categorized by age, gender, nationality, etc.).</p>

    	<h2 id="GDPR">Appendix A - GDPR concerns regarding blockchain</h2>
        <p>The EU’s 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the forerunner of human-centric data protection regulations.</p>
        <p class="ti0">While the GDPR was written using technology-agnostic wording, there are two main points of tension between its regulations and DLT:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The GDPR’s assumption that there is at least one natural or legal person – data controller – whom a data subject can address to enforce their rights over every piece of personal data.</li>
        	<li>The GDPR requires that data can be modified or erased.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ti0">GDPR-based rights of a data subject:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The right to access (Article 1)</li>
        	<li>The right to rectification (Article 16)</li>
        	<li>The right to erasure (Article 17)</li>
        	<li>The right to restriction of processing (Article 18)</li>
        	<li>The right to portability (Article 20)</li>
        	<li>The right to object (Article 21)</li>
        	<li>The right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which significantly affects them (Article 22)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Blockchains as a whole are not either compliant nor incompliant with the GDPR <a id="link_Finck_2019" href="#Finck_2019">[Finck_2019]</a> since SSI using blockchain technology can be seen as attempting similar purposes as the GDPR. However, further legal cases or further addressing need to be done to prevent the EU from falling behind in technology development.</p>
        <p class="ti0">Issues that need clarification include the following <a href="#Finck_2019">[Finck_2019]</a>:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Is anonymization an effective means of provoking the 'erasure' of data for the purposes of Article 17 GDPR?</li>
        	<li>Can a peppered hash produce anonymous data?</li>
        	<li>What is the status of the on-chain hash where transactional data is stored off-chain and subsequently erased?</li>
        	<li>What is the status of anonymity solutions such as zero-knowledge proofs under the GDPR?</li>
        	<li>Can a data subject be a data controller in relation to personal data that relates to themselves?</li>
        	<li>Is the off-chain storage of transactional data a means of complying with the data-minimization principle?</li>
        	<li>How ought 'erasure' to be interpreted for the purposes of Article 17 GDPR? Can the deletion of a private key satisfy as the erasure of on-chain data?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Chapter 2 Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the broader class of distributed ledgers that include blockchain and directed acyclic graphs (DAG).</li>
        </ul>
