    	<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
        <p>We live at a time where the world is driven by big data, transforming systems across society, including traffic, health, government, logistics, and national defense. This data is currently concentrated in “islands” by governments, internet giants, and communications institutes. However, these islands lack data credibility as there is no quality verification, and as such, they are not conducive to scientific research <a id="link_Li_2017" href="#Li_2017">[Li_2017]</a>.</p>
        <p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) drew attention more recently, providing tamper-proof distributed ledgers verified by a trustless consensus of the system’s participants. DLT technology is a global foundation for building cryptographic digital trust between companies, individuals, and machines - Trust over IP <a id="link_ToIP_2020" href="#ToIP_2020">[ToIP_2020]</a>, removing the necessity for trusted third-party intermediaries.</p>
        <p>Blockchain (BC), the most familiar form of DLT, has transitioned from cryptocurrencies (Blockchain 1.0) to Smart Contracts (Blockchain 2.0) and further development resolving deficiencies in scalability, interoperability, sustainability, privacy, and governance (Blockchain 3.0). One major change that Blockchain 3.0 aims to bring will alter the future of big data, giving control of identity back to the owners, allowing full regulation of who can use their data and how that data can be used. This will require a change or replacement of existing big data systems <a id="link_Karafiloski_2017" href="#Karafiloski_2017">[Karafiloski_2017]</a>.</p>
        <p>The Distributed Identity Foundation, with members including Microsoft and IBM, is working with the W3C and the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project to develop a unified, interoperable ecosystem allowing users to control and store identity information by creating a decentralized digital identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The aim is to create a new system of applications and products that enable developers and businesses to offer solely client-side services. "Every person has a right to an identity that they own and control, one that securely stores elements of their digital identity and preserves privacy <a id="link_Microsoft_2019" href="#Microsoft_2019">[Microsoft_2019]</a>."</p>
        <p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II covers the fundamentals of DLT and subtypes BC and DAG. Section III explores BC generations, cryptocurrency (v1.0), smart contracts (v2.0), and work in progress on scalability, interoperability, sustainability, privacy, and governance (v3.0). Section IV describes the components of Self-Sovereign Identities: Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials, and Identity Agents. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and whether SSI can meet those stipulations are touched on in Section V. SSI under active development is reviewed in Section VI. Finally, in Section VII is the conclusion.</p>

       <h2>Chapter 2: Distributed Ledger Technology Fundamentals</h2>
       <p> DLT has come to describe a broader class of technology that includes BC and directed acyclic graph (DAG). The most popular definition of a BC is “a distributed or decentralized ledger” <a id="link_Frizzo-Barker_2019" href="#Frizzo-Barker_2019">[Frizzo-Barker_2019]</a>. However, BC is a subset of distributed ledgers.</p>
       <p> Distributed ledgers offer a decentralized infrastructure realizing ‘a single version of truth’ in a linked record from the chain’s origin - referred to as the genesis block. This is done without the need for a central authority as all nodes in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network share the same full copy of the database (ledger), thereby avoiding a single point of failure (SPF) <a id="link_Zachariadis_2019" href="#Zachariadis_2019">[Zachariadis_2019]</a>.</p>
        <p>Distributed ledgers come with permissionless and permissioned transaction validation (permission to write) and public and private access (permission to read), as seen in Table 1. A company internally may choose to use a permissioned ledger with either public or private visibility, while most cryptocurrencies operate as public permissionless ledgers. Consortium ledgers are another type of permissioned ledger with equally qualified nodes often held by different entities (i.e., corporations).</p>

    	<h2 id="BC">2.1: Blockchain</h2>
        <p>BC is the most well-known form of DLT. Fundamentally, a BC offers a tamper-proof distributed ledger, or database of records, where each transaction stored is verified by consensus of the nodes (participants in the system). Transaction data is intended to be immutable once added to the chain. One party to a transaction initiates a process by requesting validating nodes to include that transaction in a block and broadcasting the block to the network. Once a block is verified through consensus of the nodes, it is added to the chain and stored across the web, resulting in a unique record with a unique history.</p>
        <p>On a BC, a data block is divided into two parts: header and body. The body’s transactions are each hashed, and the Merkle Root <a id="link_Merkle_1990" href="#Merkle_1990">[Merkle_1990]</a> is the combination of all sub hashes. The header contains the hash of the previous block as well as the Merkle root of the body. This allows for the chaining of blocks and confirmation that all sub-data is verifiably unchanged, see Figure 1.</p>
        <div class="image">

        <h4 id="MoC">2.1.1: Means of Consensus</h4>
        <p>Public BCs are distributed and not controlled by any single party. Ways to ensure that nodes are not malicious, contain accurate information, and contain a single accepted history attempt to resolve the Byzantine Generals Problem <a id="link_Lamport_2019" href="#Lamport_2019">[Lamport_2019]</a>. Bitcoin’s innovative attempt offered a means of consensus (MoC) called Proof of Work (PoW). While PoW is useful when a BC has a limited network, and many cryptocurrencies have used PoW in their nascent stage (e.g., Ethereum), other attempts</p>

<page id="" class="hf">
	<section>
    	<p class="ti0">to resolve drawbacks of PoW are being tested by other BCs <a id="link_Lee_2019" href="#Lee_2019">[Lee_2019]</a>. These include Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Delayed PoW (DPoW), Proof of Burn (PoB), Proof of Capacity (PoC), Proof of Communication (PoC) <a id="link_Chen_2019" href="#Chen_2019">[Chen_2019]</a>, and Proof of Activity (PoA) <a id="link_Liu_2019" href="#Liu_2019">[Liu_2019]</a>. Varieties specific to permissioned chains: Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), Tendermint, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) <a id="link_Viriyasitavat_2019" href="#Viriyasitavat_2019">[Viriyasitavat_2019]</a>, and others <a id="link_Zheng_2017" href="#Zheng_2017">[Zheng_2017]</a>.</p>
        
        <h4>Proof of Work</h4>
        <p>PoW requires miners to attempt guessing a nonce (value) that, when combined with the SHA-256 hash of the proposed block, results in a leading number of zeros. The first miner to correctly compute the nonce is given a predetermined prize of coins. The number of zeros required is updated according to the miners’ (nodes’) average computing power, allowing the approximate creation of one new block every 10 minutes. Due to the previous block’s hash value being included in each new block’s header, the new nonce values for any change would have to be updated in the entire chain onward from the altered block. The computing power required for this is realistically unfeasible unless more than 50% of nodes collaborate maliciously.</p> 
        <p>However, Bitcoin currently allows application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to be used in mining. This enables mining pools to work collaboratively and thus gain a large majority of hashing power, potentially altering the chain in their favor. China hosts the largest Bitcoin mining pools, over 79% total hash power, yet no pool is over 25%.</p>
        <p>Since PoW resembles a lottery for the winning miner if more than one miner guesses the correct nonce a fork could be created. Bitcoin deals with this issue by having honest miners choose to append new blocks and validate the longest chain. Alternate correct guesses that have a shorter chain, and are unused, are called uncles.</p>
        <p class="ti0">PoW has the current drawbacks:</p>
        <ul>
			<li>Waste of electricity, as miners spend large amounts of computing power for essentially a lottery ticket <a id="link_Stoll_2019" href="#Stoll_2019">[Stoll_2019,</a> <a id="link_Sutherland_2019" href="#Sutherland_2019">Sutherland_2019]</a>. However, as pointed out in <a id="link_Frizzo-Barker_2019" href="#Frizzo-Barker_2019">[Frizzo-Barker_2019</a>], creating fiat currency also uses significant power.</li>
        	<li>Slower throughput. Bitcoin has the difficulty set to one block every 10 minutes corresponding with current computing power.</li>

        <h5>Proof of Stake</h5>
        <p>PoS is the next best-known and used MoC. In PoS, the amount of stake (coins) that a stakeholder has is used with a randomized process to elect which stakeholder produces a block. Successful block creation allows the block producer to gain interest on the amount staked. More public BCs are moving toward PoS as it wastes less electricity than PoW. PoS is being integrated into Ethereum 2.0 in Serenity, its first stage also known as “beacon chain.” However, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the virtual machine running smart contracts,  still operates on Ethereum 1.0, which uses PoW.</p>
       <p> Some PoS systems solve honest behavior by locking the stake, requiring stakeholder honesty in block creation, or their stake will be destroyed/slashed (Ethereum 2.0). In the case of stake locking, some chains require a specific term of time that the coins are frozen, decreasing the cryptocurrency’s liquidity. Other chains require a specific quantity of coins to participate in staking (e.g., Ethereum 2.0 requires 32 ETH to participate in staking), thus excluding those with a small amount of coins.</p> 
        <p>The Cardano BC uses Ouroboros, a version of PoS for consensus <a id="link_Kiayias_2016" href="#Kiayias_2016">[Kiayias_2016]</a>. In Ouroboros, a randomized process is used to elect a stakeholder to produce a block based on the stake’s weight. Since individuals typically do not have a significant enough stake to be elected, they can delegate their stake to a stake pool, thereby collectively participating in a large enough stake for the stake pool to be elected. There is no minimum stake through this system, no locking of coins, and no slashing required. ADA, the name for coins on the Cardano BC, is freely spendable (i.e., liquid) at any time and can be redelegated from the end of the current epoch plus one epoch (~6-10 days).</p>
        
		<h5>Delegated Proof of Stake</h5>
		<p> DPoS is similar to PoS with ‘delegated’ meaning that a smaller group of elected members performs validation rather than the entire group. There is a random election of delegates favoring those with a larger amount staked. Block producers are responsible for grouping transactions and broadcasting them to the network, receiving rewards for progressing the network.</p>

        <h5>Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h5>
        <p>PBFT is unique in that only one network member becomes the primary participant who communicates with all other participants to validate a specific block, removing the chance of a fork. PBFT and its variants are widely used in consortium (private) chains with foreknowledge of a fixed (smaller) number of known participants. They can tolerate up to a third of participants having any form of Byzantine fault <a id="link_Castro_1999" href="#Castro_1999">[Castro_1999]</a>.</p>

            <div style="width:58%;float:left;margin-right:4%;">
                <p>Another form of DLT, DAG is a topological directed graph that prevents closed loops. Topological ordering requires that the starting vertex comes before the ending vertex, thus eliminating loops. Rather than building a chain of blocks linked to the previous one, a new transaction must link to one or two other transactions to be processed and confirmed. Only newly added transactions are confirmed, indirectly confirming the entire transaction history.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Notably, with a DAG, there is no global network state. Each network participant stores only their neighbors’ local data, relying on other regions</p>

        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the broader class of distributed ledgers that include blockchain and directed acyclic graphs (DAG).</li>
            <li>DLT realizes 'a single version of truth' linked from the origin (genesis block) in a P2P network with no central authority.</li>
            <li>Distributed ledgers come with permissionless and permissioned validation (write) and public and private access (read).</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Blockchain is an append-only chain of transactions with each block header containing the previous block's hash.</li>
            <li>Blockchain block headers contain the Merkle hash of all transactions in the block body, providing validity to unchanged transactions.</li>
            <li>Blockchains are distributed and not controlled by any single party. Common means of consensus that ensure that nodes contain accurate information include PoW, PoS, DPoS, and BFT.</li>
            <li>A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a topological directed graph, ordered temporally forward, thereby eliminating loops.</li>
